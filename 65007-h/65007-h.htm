<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">An ability to</span> furnish skilled forces to meet emergency situations on
short notice has long been a hallmark of the Marine Corps. When
the call came for such a force to be dispatched to Korea on 2 July 1950,
the Corps was handicapped by the strictures of a peacetime economy.
Nevertheless, a composite brigade consisting of a regiment and an air
group was made available within a week’s time.</p>

<p>With a reputation built largely on amphibious warfare, Marines of the
1st Brigade were called upon to prove their versatility in sustained
ground action. On three separate occasions within the embattled Perimeter—south
toward Sachon and twice along the Naktong River—these
Marine units hurled the weight of their assault force at the enemy. All
three attacks were successful, and at no point did Marines give ground
except as ordered. The quality of their performance in the difficult days
of the Pusan Perimeter fighting made them a valuable member of the
United Nations team and earned new laurels for their Corps.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">This is the</span> first volume of a planned series dealing with United
States Marine Operations in Korea during the period 2 August 1950
to 27 July 1953. Volume I is designed to give the military student and
the casual reader an accurate and detailed account of the operations in
which Marines of the 1st Provisional Brigade and Marine Air Group 33
participated during the fighting in the Pusan Perimeter, from the date of
their landing on 2 August until their withdrawal on 13 September 1950,
in preparation for the Inchon landing.</p>

<p>Since this is primarily a Marine Corps story, the activities of other
services during this period are not described in detail except to present
a proper background to the overall account.</p>

<p>Many officers and men who participated in this campaign have contributed
to the preparation of the book by answering inquiries, submitting
to interviews, and commenting on the preliminary manuscript.
Their assistance has been invaluable. Special acknowledgment is also
extended to the Office of the Chief of Military History, Department of
the Army, Pacific Section, and particularly Lieutenant Colonel Roy E.
Appleman, USA, for enemy intelligence material; to the Marine Corps
Board Study: <cite>An Evaluation of the Influence of Marine Corps Forces on the
Course of the Korean War</cite> for its interpretations and conclusions; and to
<cite>Life Magazine</cite> for courtesy shown in permitting use of Korean photographs
made by Mr. David D. Duncan. Maps included herein were prepared
by the Reproduction Section, Marine Corps Schools, Quantico,
Va. United States Army, Navy and Marine Corps photographs have also
been used to illustrate this monograph.</p>

<p class="chapsmy"><i>The Historical Background—The Russo-Japanese War—Korea as a
Japanese Colony—The Partition of Korea—Red Victory in China—Civil
Strife in Korea</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">It meant little</span> to most Americans on 25 June 1950 to read in their
Sunday newspapers that civil strife had broken out in Korea. They
could hardly have suspected that this remote Asiatic peninsula was to
become the scene of the fourth most costly military effort of American
history, both in blood and money, before the end of the year. Yet the
danger of an explosion had been present ever since the end of World
War II, when the United States and the Soviet Union rushed into the
political vacuum created in Korea by the defeat of Japan.</p>

<p>The Korean question came up officially for the first time at the Cairo
Conference of December 1943. With Soviet Russia not yet being represented
as a belligerent in the Far East, the United States, Great Britain
and China agreed that “in due course Korea shall become free and
independent.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_1" href="#FNanchor_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> Quoted in James F. Byrnes, <cite>Speaking Frankly</cite> (New York: Harper, 1947), 221.</p></div>

<p>Any discussion of this issue had to take into consideration Korea’s
status as a Japanese possession since 1910. Government, industry, commerce,
agriculture, transportation—every phase of Korean life had been
administered by Japanese for the benefit of Japan. As a consequence, the
25,000,000 inhabitants of the peninsula were woefully lacking in experience
to fit them for the responsibilities of independence.</p>

<p>Syngman Rhee, the elderly Korean patriot, had long been clamoring
for recognition of his Korean government in exile. The United States
hung back because of reluctance to offend Joseph Stalin, the Soviet dictator,
at a time when Russia was a powerful military ally. Moscow had a
strong bargaining point, moreover, in the prospect of giving military<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
aid to the United States in the fight against Japan. Such an alliance was
particularly desirable from the American viewpoint early in 1945 because
of the losses resulting from Japanese <i>kamikaze</i> tactics. In the belief that
active Soviet participation might shorten the war and save thousands of
American lives, President Franklin D. Roosevelt was disposed to compromise
with Stalin.</p>

<p>The two agreed informally at the Yalta Conference of February 1945
that Korea should be independent “... and that if a transition period
were necessary, a trusteeship should be established,” according to James
F. Byrnes, United States Secretary of State. He added in his memoirs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
that “a desire to help the Koreans develop the skills and experience that
would enable them to maintain their independence was the inspiration
for President Roosevelt’s acquiescence in the trusteeship idea.”<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn1"><a id="Footnote_2" href="#FNanchor_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> Byrnes, <i>loc. cit.</i></p></div>

<p>The Soviet dictator made a plea at Yalta for historical justice. Although
Czar Nicholas II had been execrated as a tyrant and warmonger
in Communist doctrine, Stalin demanded that the “wrongs” resulting
from the Russo-Japanese War be righted 40 years later. The price of
Soviet military aid against Japan, in short, was the restoration of Russian
territory in the Far East that had been lost in the defeat of 1905.</p>

<h3><i>The Historical Background</i></h3>

<p>It was inevitable that the fate of Korea would be involved in any such
readjustment. Korea is one of those tragic areas of the earth’s surface
which are destined in all ages to be a doorstep of strategy. As the focal
point of the China-Russia-Japan triangle, the peninsula offers each of
these powers a threshold for aggression against either of the other two.
Possession of Korea has been for centuries an aim of aspiring conquerors
in the Far East, and all three rival nations have had a turn.</p>

<p>China was first. From ancient times down to the last quarter of the
19th century, the Chinese Empire held a loose suzerainty acknowledged
by the Koreans. Japan won a brief foothold in the 16th century under
the great war lord Hideyoshi, only to learn the painful lesson that control
of the sea is requisite to a seaborne invasion of a peninsula. Naval
victories by the Koreans cut Hideyoshi’s line of communications, and he
withdrew after frightful devastations which left an enduring tradition of
fear and hate. Both Japan and Korea then entered upon a period of self-imposed
isolation lasting until their political hibernation was rudely interrupted
by Western nations clamoring for trade.</p>

<p>The United States took the lead in inaugurating a new era in the Far
East. Commodore Perry and his American warships opened up Japan to
commerce in 1853. Several persuasive bombardments of coastal cities by
American, British and French naval guns were required to end Japan’s
seclusion; and in 1871 an American squadron was sent to Korea after the
destruction of an American merchant ship and massacre of its crew.
United States Marines and bluejackets stormed Korean river forts defended
by cannon. All objectives were taken and heavy casualties<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
inflicted, but it remained for Japan to open up the “Hermit Kingdom”
to trade 4 years later with the threat of war.</p>

<p>Russia had not been a disinterested bystander during this era of cannon-ball
diplomacy. Her participation in Far Eastern affairs dated back
to the 17th century and had once extended to the North American
mainland. The sale of Alaska to the United States in 1867 indicated a
renunciation of this phase of expansion, but Russia had no intention of
abandoning her ambitions in the Far East. Shortly after Japan compelled
Korea to sign a treaty of amity, the Russians offered to train Korean officers
and lend military aid to the faction-ridden kingdom.</p>

<p>At this point China took a hand. Suspecting that the two rival nations
were dabbling in Korean affairs for purposes of their own, the Celestial
Empire attempted to restore her suzerainty.</p>

<p>This policy was bound to lead to a collision. Western nations were
not surprised when Japan and China resorted to arms, but few observers
expected the supposed dwarf to beat the giant with ease. Japan’s well
led army, equipped with the best modern weapons, landed at Chemulpo
(Inchon) and captured the Chinese fortress at Pyongyang in northwest
Korea. Sweeping across the Yalu into Manchuria, the invaders overran
the strategic Liaotung Peninsula, taking Port Arthur and Dairen.</p>

<p>It was all over in a few months. When the Empire proper was threatened
with invasion, the Chinese government sued for peace in 1895.</p>

<p>The Japanese terms were more than severe, they were humiliating.
They included: (1) a large indemnity; (2) the cession “in perpetuity”
of the Liaotung Peninsula as well as Formosa and the Pescadores group;
and (3) Chinese recognition of what the Japanese were pleased to call
“Korean independence.”</p>

<p>But the victors had overdone it. Russia, Germany, and France formed
the Triple Intervention which compelled Japan to relinquish the Liaotung
Peninsula. The three European powers preferred that this strategic
bastion remain in the possession of China, which was ripe for despoiling
at the convenience of the Western nations.</p>

<p>Russia now assumed the role of a friend binding China’s wounds. The
secret treaty of alliance signed by the two empires in 1896 was aimed
like a pistol at Japan. In return for promises of support in the event of
further Japanese aggressions, China gave Russia the right to extend the
Trans-Siberian Railroad to Vladivostok across Chinese territory in
Manchuria.</p>

<p>The precept was not lost upon other European nations. England,
Germany, and France also established spheres of influence in China after<span class="pagenum"><a class="hidep" id="Page_5">5</a><a id="Page_6">6</a></span>
forcing the government to lease territory or grant special privileges. And
Russia added to former gains by a 25-year lease of the Liaotung
Peninsula.</p>

  <div class="caption">THE FAR EAST</div></div>

<p>China’s Boxer Rebellion of 1900 interrupted the march of events, but
two treaties in 1902 indicated that Japan and Russia would soon be at
each other’s throats. Japan acquired an ally in England, as a result of that
nation’s alarms over Muscovite designs, so that the neutrality of European
powers was practically assured. Russia and China drew closer meanwhile
with a new treaty of alliance. The stage was set for a fight to the
finish in the Far East.</p>

<p>Possession of the Philippine Islands had given the United States a
new interest in Far Eastern affairs since the Spanish-American War of
1898. John Hay, Secretary of State, realized that the American “open
door” policy was imperiled by the situation in Asia.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> But he admitted in
April 1903 that nothing short of the threat of armed force could have
checked Russia’s encroachments.</p>

<h3><i>The Russo-Japanese War</i></h3>

<p>A candid comparison would reveal a striking similarity between the aggressions
of Czarist Russia in the early 1900’s and those of Soviet Russia
half a century later. The expression “cold war” was not current in 1903,
but the account of Russia’s threats, seizures and violated agreements has
a dismally familiar aspect to the modern reader. Rudyard Kipling paid a
bitter tribute at the turn of the century to these techniques of the Russian
Bear in his lines:</p>

<div class="poem-container">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When he stands up like a tired man, tottering near and near;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he stands up as pleading, in wavering, man-brute guise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he veils the hate and cunning of his little swinish eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he shows as seeking quarter, with paws like hands in prayer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That is the time of peril—the time of the Truce of the Bear!<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p>Following the Sino-Japanese War, the truce between Russia and
Japan in “independent” Korea was broken by both nations whenever a
favorable opportunity arose. Both of them intrigued constantly at Seoul.
For a time, indeed, the Korean government was directed from the Russian
legation with the backing of Russian troops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
Twice, in 1896 and 1898, Russia and Japan signed agreements reaffirming
Korea’s independence and promising anew to withdraw their forces.
These pacts were promptly violated by both contestants for power, but
Japan prepared more realistically for the forthcoming struggle. On a
February night in 1904, without the formality of a declaration of war, a
Japanese squadron attacked the Russian warships anchored at Port
Arthur. This surprise blow was followed shortly by the landing of Japanese
troops at Chemulpo. They advanced to the frontier and defeated
the Russians in the battle of the Yalu—a victory that has been compared
with the battle of Valmy in the French Revolution as a landmark of
history.</p>

<p>Certainly the West was made aware that an Oriental nation had risen
to the stature of a world power for the first time in modern history. The
value of Korea as a strategic springboard was demonstrated when Japanese
land and sea forces isolated the fortresses on the Liaotung Peninsula.
Port Arthur fell after a bloody siege of 6 months. Next, the Japanese
invaders of Manchuria defeated an army of 350,000 Russians and
inflicted 150,000 casualties in the four-week battle of Mukden. This was
the decisive clash on land; and in the one-sided naval battle of Tsushima,
Admiral Togo annihilated the Baltic fleet which the Czar had ordered on
the long voyage to the Pacific.</p>

<p>The end came abruptly in the summer of 1905. In the Treaty of Portsmouth,
signed on 5 September, Russia ceded the southern part of Sakhalin
Island to the victors while recognizing their “paramount” interests
in Korea. All rights in the Liaotung Peninsula went to Japan as well as
important concessions in Manchuria. Not much was left to Russia in
the Far East except a precarious foothold in northern Manchuria.</p>

<h3><i>Korea as a Japanese Colony</i></h3>

<p>For 5 years Japan kept up a pretense of a protectorate in Korea. Then,
in 1910, came outright annexation.</p>

<p>Europe’s “balanced antagonisms” soon flared up in World War I,
leaving Japan free to exploit Korea as a colony. Western observers
might have noted such evidences of modernization as new docks, railroads,
factories and highways. But they were administered by Japanese
overseers as Koreans sank to the level of coolies without a voice in the
government.</p>

<p>Although Japan joined the fight against the Central Powers in World<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
War I, her military efforts were made against allies as well as enemies.
Using Korea as a beachhead, she attempted to enlarge her empire on the
Asiatic mainland at the expense of Russia, then in the throes of revolution.
Three years after the Armistice, a Japanese army still occupied
the Vladivostok area; but the United States took such a firm diplomatic
stand that Tokyo backed down.</p>

<p>This retreat was only a postponement. During the next decade Japan
set up a strategic shield to the east and south by fortifying the mandated
islands of the Pacific, awarded to her after the war. Treaties and agreements
were violated whenever convenient, and in 1931 she turned westward
again to satisfy her appetite for Russian and Chinese territory.</p>

<p>The time was well chosen. With the Western nations in the depths
of an industrial depression, Japan began a series of aggressions against
the Chinese in Manchuria. The gains were consolidated in a puppet
state known as Manchukuo, comprising a fertile and populous area as
large as California. China was unable to offer much resistance, and Soviet
Russia could not risk a major war in the Far East. Even so, some of
the Soviet border clashes with the Japanese in time of “peace” were
actually battles fought with tanks and planes.</p>

<p>In 1937 came the Japanese invasion of China proper. Germany and
Italy were launching aggressions of the same stamp in Europe and
Africa, and the world was to know little stability until all three totalitarian
states had been crushed in World War II.</p>

<p>Soviet Russia had a grim struggle for survival while resisting the full
tide of Nazi invasion. But at the time of the Yalta Conference, Stalin
was in a position to ask a stiff price for military aid in the Pacific. The
United States agreed that the Port Arthur area and southern Sakhalin
should be returned to Russia to redress the “wrongs” of 1905. Concessions
were also made in Manchuria and outer Mongolia.</p>

<p>Stalin, for his part, consented to sign a treaty of friendship with Nationalist
China as an ally of the United States. Later events made it evident
that he had no intention of keeping his pledges. On the contrary,
Soviet policy already visioned a Communist empire in the Far East
which would include China as well as Korea.</p>

<p>The Yalta Agreement was stridently criticized in the United States
after Stalin’s duplicity became apparent. But the War Department took
a realistic view as early as the spring of 1945:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The concessions to Russia on Far Eastern matters which were made at Yalta are
generally matters which are within the military power of Russia to obtain regardless
of United States military action short of war.... The Russians can, if they choose,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
await the time when United States efforts will have practically completed the destruction
of Japanese military power and can then seize the objectives they desire at
a cost to them relatively much less than would be occasioned by their entry into the
war at an early date.”<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This was precisely what happened. Moscow waited to declare war
until 8 August 1945—6 days before the imminent collapse of Japan.
Soviet forces fought only a few actions in Siberia with a Japanese army
stripped of planes for home defense. As a consequence, Russian propagandists
found it hard to paint a convincing picture of “the heroic deeds
of our brave Far Eastern warriors.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> Obviously they had met little
resistance while overrunning Manchuria and northern Korea to accept
the surrender of nearly 600,000 Japanese troops, including 148 generals.

despoiled Manchuria of heavy machinery, turbines, dynamos
and rolling stock.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></p>

Conference in July 1945.</p></div>

<p>The value of this booty has been estimated at a billion dollars, and
the forced labor of Japanese war prisoners during the next 5 years was
worth at least another billion. Not satisfied with these spoils, Moscow
also demanded a share in the occupation of Japan. This design was

<p>Even after the guns fell silent, there was no peace. One enemy had
been exchanged for another, since Soviet Russia took advantage of war-weary
allies to follow in the footsteps of Germany and Japan. There was
the same familiar pattern of encroachment both in Europe and the Far
East. There were the same violations of treaties, the same unfriendly
acts falling just short of hostilities. The cold war had begun.</p>

<p>Oppression at home and aggression abroad—this had been the policy
of Russia’s czars, and it became the policy of Russia’s dictators. Despotism
had been replaced by Communism, but there was little difference.
Communism proved to be an old tyranny presented as a new ideology,
and Joseph Stalin succeeded where Nicholas II failed. Circumstances<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
were kinder to Stalin, and he gobbled up territory in Poland, Estonia,
Latvia, Czechoslovakia, Austria, Germany, Hungary, Rumania, Mongolia
and Manchuria.</p>

<p>Never before had one man ruled so much of the earth’s surface. Yet
there was something neurotic and fear-ridden about the Kremlin’s outlook
which success could not cure. It has long been a historical theory
that this psychosis may be traced back to Russia’s bondage in the Middle
Ages under the Mongols and Tartars. At any rate, victory and enormous
spoils did not give Moscow a sense of security in 1945. Buffer state was
piled upon buffer state, and thousands of World War II prisoners were
enslaved behind the “iron curtain” to build new Soviet military
installations.</p>

<h3><i>The Partition of Korea</i></h3>

<p>The importance of Korea in the Soviet scheme of things was indicated
by the haste with which Russian troops crossed the frontier on 12
August 1945, three days after the declaration of war. They were the vanguard
of an army numbering a quarter of a million men led by General
Ivan Chistyakov, a hero of the battle of Stalingrad.</p>

<p>The surrender terms called for a joint American and Soviet occupation,
with the 38th parallel serving as a temporary line of demarcation.
Not until 8 September, however, did Lieutenant General John R. Hodge
reach southern Korea with the first American troops.</p>

<p>By that time the Russians had gone through their usual routine, and
the machinery taken from northern Korea was estimated at 30 to 40
percent of the industrial potential. Looting by Soviet troops went unpunished,
and regular supplies of food for the huge army were
demanded from an impoverished people just freed of the Japanese yoke.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>The Russians had a tremendous advantage over United States occupation
forces. Since World War I more than a million Koreans had found
a refuge from Japanese bondage on Russian or Chinese soil. Thousands
of men had been indoctrinated with Communist principles and given
military training to aid the Chinese Reds fighting the Japanese invaders
of China. Thus in 1945 the Russians could count on the efforts of
Korean revolutionists to establish Communist rule in their homeland
behind a façade of democracy.</p>

<p>The United States forces, on the contrary, did not even have enough<span class="pagenum"><a class="hidep" id="Page_11">11</a><a id="Page_12">12</a></span>
interpreters. They impressed the Koreans at first as being alien occupation
troops setting up a military government. Meanwhile, the Russians
had installed an interim civil government at Pyongyang. Korean Reds
filled the key positions, and Stalin’s portraits and the hammer and sickle
emblem were seen at political rallies.</p>

<p>Koreans of all persuasions opposed the division of their country into
two zones on either side of the 38th parallel. The Reds at Pyongyang
contrived to lay the blame on the Americans. They made a further appeal
to Koreans on both sides of the boundary by announcing a land reform
in the northern zone. Ever since 1905 a Japanese landlord had been the
hated symbol of oppression. Pyongyang won a great propaganda victory,
therefore, by announcing the confiscation of all large estates, Korean as
well as Japanese, and the division of the land among the peasantry.</p>

<p>The bait was so tempting that the hook did not become apparent until
too late. Then the beneficiaries of the Agrarian Reform discovered that
they could neither sell nor rent the land, nor could they use it as security
for loans. If anyone ceased to work his holding, it reverted to the People’s
Committee, which allocated it to some other family. The State retained
possession, in short, and the peasant remained as much of a serf as ever.
Worse yet, the taxes disguised as “production quotas” eventually
amounted to 60 percent of the total crop, which was more than the
Japanese had extorted.<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>

<p>This is a sample of the methods used to reduce North Korea to a
police state, just as similar states were being organized in occupied lands
of Europe by local Reds doing the bidding of Moscow. In the Soviet
zone of Korea all banks, factories and industries of any consequence were
nationalized by the so-called People’s Committee.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> Military training for

<h3><i>Red Victory in China</i></h3>

<p>Moscow was secretly backing the Communists led by Mao Tse-tung in
their efforts to wrest China from the Nationalist government of Chiang<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
Kai-shek. Such activities, of course, were in violation of the treaty of
friendship and alliance with Nationalist China which Stalin had signed
on 14 August 1945. But agreements were never allowed to interfere with
Soviet ambitions, and Moscow aimed to create in Asia a bulwark of
Communist puppet states extending from the Arctic to the tropics.</p>

<p>Asiatic soil was peculiarly suited to the growth of such institutions.
Although Communism derived originally from the theories of a German
revolutionist, Karl Marx, it was adapted by Lenin and Stalin to the
political climate of Asia. Human lives and liberties have always been
held cheaply in the East, and absolutism has been the rule in government.
Communism, as it developed in Russia after the revolution of
1917, would probably have been better understood by Genghis Khan
than Marx. For it is significant that no Western nation has ever embraced
this political faith voluntarily, even though it has attracted a
minority of radicals and malcontents in nearly every country.</p>

<p>Asia was ripe for change after World War II. In spite of Japan’s defeat,
that nation had made a good deal of progress with its “Asia for the
Asiatics” propaganda. The Far East seethed with unrest in 1946, and
Communism spread ominously through a China weakened by three
decades of invasion, revolution and civil war.</p>

<p>While Nationalists and Communist armies contended for the ancient
empire, an undeclared war went on in the background. This was the cold
war between the United States and Soviet Russia as they supplied arms
and munitions to the opposing forces. Russia also supplied troops and
laborers. For it has been estimated that no less than 250,000 North
Korean Reds were induced to serve in various capacities with the
Chinese Communists in Manchuria.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> There the soldiers completed their
military training in actual combat, with veteran Chinese officers as
instructors.</p>

<p>By 1948 there was no longer much doubt about the outcome in China.
In the battles of Tsinan, Changchun and Mukden, the Nationalists lost
33 divisions, totaling more than 320,000 men, in killed, wounded and
missing. Losses of equipment included 250,000 rifles and vast quantities
of other arms and equipment. During the four and a half months following
the fall of Tsinan in September 1948, the Nationalist losses were
estimated at a million men and 400,000 rifles. Even planes of United
States manufacture were captured by the Reds, who also acquired a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
cruiser that the British had transferred to the Nationalists.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></p>

Printing Office [GPO], 1949), 357.</p></div>

<p>“The unfortunate but inescapable fact,” concluded the United States
State Department in 1949, “is that the ominous result of the civil war in
China was beyond the control of the Government of the United States.
Nothing that this country did or could have done within the reasonable
limits of those capabilities could have changed that result; nothing that
was left undone by this country could have contributed to it. It was the
product of internal Chinese forces, forces which this country tried to
influence but could not. A decision was arrived at within China, if only
a decision by default.”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a></p>

<p>As a result, Mao Tse-tung’s forces could claim a sweeping victory by
the end of 1949. Only the island of Formosa was left to Chiang Kai-shek
and his battered remnants. Meanwhile, it grew increasingly plain that
Korea was destined to be the scene of the next great tug-of-war between
Communism and the free nations.</p>

<h3><i>Civil Strife in Korea</i></h3>

<p>Not only had the Russians made the 38th Parallel a political boundary
in Korea; they had also resisted all American attempts at unification.
This meant that economic recovery was badly handicapped. For the
mines, heavy industries and hydroelectric plants were located in the
north, while the south had most of the agriculture. Products once exchanged
with mutual benefit now had to be imported from abroad.</p>

<p>Trusteeship was hotly resented by all Koreans, even though few of
them had gained administrative or technical experience under the Japanese.
This prejudice was exploited by Soviet propagandists who denounced
the “undemocratic” American policy of bringing in administrators,
technicians and educators. As a consequence, the United States
military government made a poor showing at first in comparison to the
puppet government of Communist-trained Koreans installed at Pyongyang
by Russians pulling the strings behind the scenes. Anti-American
propaganda won converts to the south as well as north of the 38th
Parallel, with General Hodge being accused of maintaining a harsh military
rule.</p>

<p>At the Moscow Conference of 1945 the Soviet Union had agreed with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
the United States that the whole of Korea was to be given a democratic
government after passing through the trusteeship phase. A Soviet-American
Joint Commission was to meet and make recommendations
for this purpose; but as early as 1946 it became evident that the Soviet
representatives had been instructed to sabotage any attempt to create
a united Korea with its own government.</p>

<p>After the failure of the first year’s efforts, Hodge ordered the establishment
of an Interim Legislature at Seoul as the counterpart of the People’s
Assembly at Pyongyang. Of the 90 seats, half were to be filled by
popular vote and the remaining 45 by Korean appointees of the Military
Government. The election was a triumph for the American-educated
Dr. Syngman Rhee and the rightists. Hodge tried to give the other
South Korean factions a voice by appointing moderates and liberals, but
the Interim Legislature had no solution for the discontent in Korea as
the economic situation went from bad to worse in spite of American aid.</p>

<p>Although the Americans on the Joint Commission did their best, they
were blocked by all manner of Soviet-contrived delays and obstacles.
Finally, in 1947, the United States submitted the question to the United
Nations. After long discussion, the General Assembly resolved that all
the people of Korea be given an opportunity in the spring of 1948 to
elect a national assembly for the entire country.</p>

<p>A commission representing nine member nations was appointed to
visit Korea and supervise the voting. But the Russians not only refused
to participate in the election; they went so far as to bar the commissioners
from entering North Korea.</p>

<p>The new National Assembly elected in May 1948 by South Korea had
the task of forming a government. On 17 July the first constitution in 40
years of Korean history was approved by the deputies, who elected
Syngman Rhee to a 4-year term as president.</p>

<p>It was an eventful summer south of the 38th Parallel. The Republic
of Korea came into being on 15 August, and on that day the American
military government ended. John J. Muccio was appointed by President
Truman to represent the United States in Korea with the rank of ambassador.
Plans were made to withdraw the 50,000 United States occupation
troops during the next 8 months, leaving only 500 officers and men as
military instructors for the training of a Republic of Korea security force.</p>

<p>In the northern zone the Communists organized demonstrations
against the United Nations Commission. Strikes and disorders were
fomented south of the 38th Parallel, and 200,000 North Koreans
marched in protest at Pyongyang.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
There was an air of urgency about such attempts to prevent the election
in South Korea. The exposure of the Agrarian Reform as a fraud
had hurt the Communists, and the disinterested spirit of the United
States occupation was gaining recognition throughout Korea in spite of
initial blunders. Pyongyang could not afford to let South Korea take
the lead in forming a government, and July 1948 dated the creation of
a Communist state known as the People’s Democratic Republic of Korea.
After adopting a constitution modeled after that of Communist Bulgaria,
the Supreme People’s Council claimed to represent all Korea. In
justification it was charged that “American imperialists carried out a
ruinous separate election and organized a so-called National Assembly
with the support of a traitor minority and with the savage oppression of
the majority of the Korean people.”<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></p>

<p>The Russians announced in December 1948 that they were withdrawing
all occupation troops. It was no secret, however, that they would
leave behind them an NK army that far surpassed the ROK military
establishment.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> Kim Il Sung, the Red Korean prime minister, referred
to it pointedly as a “superior army” in an address at Pyongyang.</p>

<p>Numbers at the end of 1948 were estimated at 60,000 regulars in addition
to constabulary, railroad guards, and trainees. These troops were
equipped by the Russians with captured Japanese weapons, and Russian
arms were shipped into northern Korea to meet the needs of an expanding
army.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<p>It was a military force of an entirely different character that American
officers organized on the other side of the 38th Parallel. The new ROK
army was strictly a defensive force, trained and equipped to maintain
internal security and guard the border and seacoast. Neither tanks nor
military planes were provided by the Americans, who leaned backward
to avoid any suspicion of creating an instrument for offensive internecine
warfare.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
Raids by Red Korean troops across the border became a frequent
occurrence throughout 1949. One of these forays, supported by artillery,
was a large-scale NK thrust into the Ongjin Peninsula. Heavy fighting
resulted before the invaders were driven back into their own territory.</p>

<p>Having failed to prevent the formation of a democratic Korean government—the
only government in Korea recognized by the United
Nations—the Reds at Pyongyang were making every effort to wreck it.
Since 80 percent of the ROK electric power originated north of the frontier,
they were able to retard economic recovery by cutting off the current
at intervals. There was no other unfriendly act in the Communist
bagful of tricks that Pyongyang neglected to employ while its radio stations
blared forth a propaganda of hatred.</p>

<p>Early in 1950 the situation grew more tense daily as thousands of
veterans returned to North Korea after serving in the Communist armies
which overran China. When Radio Pyongyang began making appeals
for peace that spring, it should have become obvious to practiced observers
of Communist techniques that preparations were afoot for war.
On 10 June 1950 the Pyongyang government announced a new plan for
unification and peace after branding the top ROK officials as “traitors.”
The motive behind this proposal was apparently the usual Communist
attempt to divide an enemy on the eve of an aggression. For the long-planned
blow fell at 0400 (Korean time) on Sunday morning, 25 June
1950. Russian-made tanks spearheaded the advance of the NK ground
forces across the 38th Parallel, and Russian-made planes strafed Seoul
and other strategic centers.</p>

<p>Captured NK documents offer proof that the invaders had already set
the machinery of aggression in motion while making their plea for peace.
This evidence included the written report of instructions given by one
Lieutenant Han to a group of picked men on an intelligence mission.
On 1 June 1950 they were to proceed by power boat to an island off Inchon,
where confederates would help them make their way to the mainland.
“Our mission,” explained Han, “is to gather intelligence information
concerning South Korean forces and routes of advance ahead of our
troops. We will perform this task by contacting our comrades who are
scattered throughout the length and breadth of South Korea.”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p>

<p>The lieutenant explained that the forthcoming attack on South Korea
was to be the first step toward the “liberation” of the people of Asia.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
And his concluding remarks leave no doubt as to the complete confidence
with which the Korean Communists began the venture:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Within 2 months from the date of attack, Pusan should have fallen and South
Korea will be again united with the North. The timetable for this operation of 2
months’ duration was determined by the possibility of United States forces intervening
in the conflict. If this were not so, it would take our forces only 10 days to overrun
South Korea.”<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p></blockquote>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">It was an</span> army of veterans that broke the world’s peace in Korea.
There were thousands of veterans of the Chinese civil war and Manchurian
guerrilla operations. There were even a few scarred warriors who
had served with the Soviet forces in such World War II operations as
the defense of Stalingrad.</p>

<p>Practically all the commissioned and noncommissioned officers were
battle-hardened, and a majority of the rank and file had seen action. The
origins of this army were deeply rooted in Asiatic soil. During World
War II an endless stream of Koreans escaped from Japanese bondage
and found a refuge in Soviet or Chinese territory. Some of them took to
banditry, others were absorbed into the Soviet or Red Chinese armed
forces. These refugees dreamed of a united and independent homeland;
and at Yenan, China, the Chinese Communists encouraged this movement
as early as 1939 by supplying arms to a force known as the Korean
Volunteer Army. During the first month alone the KVA attracted 3,000
recruits, and at the end of the war an advance column marched back to
Korea under a leader named Kim Mu Chong.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_21" href="#FNanchor_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> FECOM, ATIS, <cite>History of the North Korean Army</cite>, <i>op. cit.</i>, 17–28.</p></div>

<p>Although the heads of the KVA had been thoroughly impregnated
with Communist doctrine at Yenan, they were coldly received by General
Chistyakov and the Russian occupation forces. It was a Soviet puppet
state that the Kremlin wished to see established in Korea, not a Red-tinted
independent Korean government. Communist right-thinking did
not save Kim Mu Chong and his KVA troops from the humiliation of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
being stopped at the frontier in September 1945 and disarmed.</p>

<p>The Russian commander piously justified his decision on grounds of
upholding international law. But he offered to return the confiscated
arms if the Korean Reds would retrace their steps and join the CCF
fight against the Nationalists. He promised that after the struggle had
been won, the KVA would be welcomed back to Korea.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_22" href="#FNanchor_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>Accepting these terms, Kim Mu Chong marched into Manchuria to
aid the Chinese Reds. His force numbered nearly 20,000 the following
spring, but the KVA lost its identity when the men were mingled with
Chinese and Mongolians in the CCF Northeast Democratic United
Army. Most of the officers and NCO’s of the former KVA were organized
into teams to recruit and train Korean volunteers both in Manchuria
and Korea. As combined military instructors and political commissars,
they created an integrated Communist force out of such oddly
assorted material as peasants, guerrillas and bandits. Used first as security
troops and later welded into a regular army structure, these thousands of
Korean Reds undoubtedly had the principal part in “liberating” Manchuria
from the Chinese Nationalists.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the Russian occupation forces did not neglect the conversion
of North Korea into a satellite state. One of the first steps was
the establishment of a military academy at Pyongyang in the autumn of
1945. Founded ostensibly for the training of police, it had as its primary
purpose the instruction of army officers. Graduates of the first and second
classes became teachers when branches of the academy were set up
at Nanam, Sinuiju and Hamhung. These offshoots, known as the Peace
Preservation Officers’ Schools, turned out the cadres which were later
activated as the 1st, 2d and 3d Divisions of the new North Korean army.
For more than 2 years, however, the fiction was maintained that graduates
were to patrol rural areas, protect railroads and guard the frontier.</p>

<h3><i>Units of North Korean Army</i></h3>

<p>Not until 8 February 1948 did the “North Korean People’s Army” come
into official being with the activation of the 1st, 2d and 3d Infantry
Divisions. At that time there were some 30,000 troops and 170,000
trainees in North Korea, according to later United States Army intelligence
estimates.<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_23" href="#FNanchor_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> <i>Ibid.</i>, 23–24.</p></div>

<p>The 4th Infantry Division was formed in 1948 from trainees plus a
veteran regiment transferred from the 2d Division. Two new infantry
divisions, the 5th and 6th, were organized the following year when
Korean veterans of the 164th and 166th CCF Divisions returned as units
with their arms and equipment.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_24" href="#FNanchor_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> <i>Ibid.</i>, 52–75.</p></div>

<p>It is probable that the leaders of the North Korean state were committed
early in 1950 to the invasion of the Republic of Korea. At any
rate, the training and organization of new units was accelerated during
the spring months. From February to June nine new divisions were activated—the
7th, 8th, 9th, 12th, 13th, 14th, and 15th Infantry Divisions,
10th Mechanized Infantry Division and 105th Armored Division.<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_25" href="#FNanchor_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>Two factors combined to hasten the NKPA aggression. It had undoubtedly
become evident to the Kremlin in 1949 that the Republic of
Korea could never be brought into the Communist fold by propaganda,
subversion, incitation of disorders or any other means short of a victorious
civil war. Moreover, a successful war of invasion was equally desirable
as a cure for political discontent at home. Not only was the
Agrarian Reform resented everywhere in North Korea, but taxes had
gone up as high as 60 percent of the crops to maintain the top-heavy
military structure and pay for tanks, planes, howitzers and other arms
supplied by the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>Although most of the heavy industries of Korea were located north
of the 38th Parallel, they included no arms plants with the exception of
a small factory capable of turning out submachineguns and ammunition.
North Korea was also able to produce 80 percent of its own POL
products for military purposes and some of the army uniforms. Other
supplies, all the way from the Tokarev semiautomatic pistol (adapted
from the U. S. .45 Colt) to the T-34 tank, were imported from the
U. S. S. R.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<p>Most of the weapons were old models of recent manufacture. The
heaviest load came by rail from Siberia through Manchuria via Antung
and crossed the Yalu into Korea at Sinuiju. As many as three freight
trains a day rumbled over the bridge between those cities and continued
along the west coast to Pyongyang. Supplies were also received from
Vladivostok by water to Chongjin or by the east coast rail line to
Wonsan.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_27" href="#FNanchor_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>It must also be remembered that thousands of Korean veterans of the
Chinese civil war returned with their arms and equipment, including
American-manufactured weapons surrendered by the Nationalists. The
NKPA was second only to the Soviet Army itself in the spring of 1950
as the best armed and equipped military force of its size in the Far East.</p>

<p>The U. S. S. R. did not limit its aid to arms. Lieutenant General
Vasilev and a group of Soviet military instructors arrived at Pyongyang
in 1949 to train NKPA staff and line officers for offensive warfare. About
3,000 promising NKPA candidates were sent to Soviet schools that year
for courses in such specialties as artillery, air and tank tactics.</p>

<p>Of the original 14 NKPA divisions, the first 6 were composed largely
of well trained troops. The 12th Division, like the 5th and 6th, consisted
of Korean veterans of the Chinese civil war. Constabulary troops
made up the 8th and 9th, while the 7th, 13th, 14th, and 15th Infantry
Divisions and the 10th Mechanized Infantry Division were formed of
conscripted trainees for the most part.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<p>The picture grows confused in the spring of 1950, with 8 new divisions
being organized in 5 months. Many of the recently drafted men
received only the most sketchy training; and some of the older units
were weakened by drawing off well trained men to stiffen the new outfits.
All accounts agree, however, that the NKPA leaders anticipated an
effort of only a few days, ending with the destruction of the ROK army.
This was not an unreasonable assumption, since a swarm of NKPA spies
had brought back accurate reports of unpreparedness. Not only was the
Republic of Korea weak militarily, but a bad economic situation had
been made worse by increased population due to immigration.</p>

<p>Altogether, Pyongyang could put nearly 100,000 fairly well-trained
and armed troops in the field, with about half of that number in reserve
as replacements, occupation troops or constabulary. But the problem of
man power did not worry Communists who were not squeamish about
violations of international law. For the aggressors planned to make war
nourish war by conscripting both soldiers and laborers in invaded
regions of the Republic of Korea. It was an old Asiatic custom.</p>

<h3><i>NKPA Command and Leadership</i></h3>

<p>With few exceptions, the North Korean war leaders proved to be willing
and able instruments of policies formulated in Moscow. Kim Il<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
Sung, the prime minister and commander in chief, was an imposter
named Kim Sung Chu who made a bid for popular support by taking
the name of a dead Korean resistance hero. As a youth he had fled from
Korea and joined the Communist party in Manchuria. There he distinguished
himself in guerrilla operations against the Japanese. In 1938,
after rising to the stature of a corps commander, he met military reverses
and found a refuge in Soviet territory. Legend has it that he attended
a Soviet military academy and took part in the battle of Stalingrad.
However this may be, he returned to Korea in August 1945 as a
35-year-old captain in the Soviet army of occupation.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_29" href="#FNanchor_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> <i>Ibid.</i>, 90–99. Communist chiefs preferred to work behind a screen of secrecy and deception,
so that it was difficult to obtain accurate personal data. Not only did some of the
NKPA war leaders have obscure origins, but they added to the difficulties of biographers by
deliberately falsifying the record for propaganda purposes. It is to the credit of U.S. Army
intelligence officers that they have managed to piece out this material from prisoner interrogations
and captured enemy documents.</p></div>

<p>South Korean descriptions of Kim Il Sung as an uneducated ruffian
were doubtless prejudiced, but certainly he was a ruthless guerrilla leader
who showed an uncommon aptitude for politics. His rise in the new
North Korean state was spectacular, for in September 1948 he became
the first prime minister. The following year he went to Moscow for conferences
at the Kremlin, and nine days after the outbreak of civil war in
Korea he was appointed commander in chief of the invading army while
retaining his position as prime minister.</p>

<p>In contrast to this rough diamond, Marshal Choe Yong Gun cut a
reserved and dignified figure as deputy commander in chief and minister
of national defense. Born in Hongchon, Korea, at the turn of the century,
he had the equivalent of a high school education. In 1925 he went
to China and is believed to have attended the Whampoa Military
Academy at Nanking and the Yenan Military School. At Yenan, after
being converted to communism, he became a political instructor and
later served in the 8th Route Army. Choe was commander of the Korean
Volunteer Army in 1941 and fought against the Japanese in Manchuria.
Returning to Korea in 1945, he commanded the Cadre Training Center
until 1948, when he was named the first commander in chief.</p>

<p>Even Choe’s enemies in South Korea credited him with a high order
of intellectual capacity and moral courage. Despite his Communist party
membership, he opposed the invasion of the Republic of Korea. He was
cool, moreover, toward Lieutenant General Vasilev and the other Soviet
advisers who reached Pyongyang in 1949 to prepare the Korean armed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
forces for an offensive war. This attitude probably explains why he was
sidetracked in March 1950, when Vasilev took charge of the combat
training and re-equipment program. Although Choe was not on good
terms with Kim Il Sung at this time, he was regarded as a superior strategist
and administrator. And after being bypassed temporarily, he continued
to be respected as a leader by the North Korean army and
peasantry.</p>

<p>Nam Il stood out as the most cosmopolitan and polished of the
North Korean war leaders. Born in 1911, he was Kim Il Sung’s schoolmate
in Manchuria and the two remained lifelong friends. As a young
man, Nam Il made his way across the U. S. S. R. to Smolensk and attended
college and a military academy. He entered the Soviet army at
the outbreak of World War II and is said to have participated along with
Kim Il Sung in the Stalingrad defense.</p>

<p>Both of them returned to Korea with the rank of captain in the Soviet
army of occupation, and both entered upon successful Communist
political careers. In 1948 Nam Il was elected to the Supreme People’s
Council and became vice-minister of education in charge of military instruction.
The most Russianized of the North Korean leaders, he took
pains to cultivate the good will of the Soviet advisers. Speaking English,
Russian, and Chinese as well as Korean, he held an advantage over his
North Korean rivals in such contacts. He also made a better appearance,
being tall for an Oriental and always well turned out in a meticulously
pressed uniform and gleaming boots.</p>

<p>A major general without an active field command at the outbreak of
war, he was rapidly advanced to the rank of lieutenant general and chief
of staff. His stern demeanor, while seated stiffly in his black Chrysler
driven by a uniformed chauffeur, soon became one of the most impressive
sights of Pyongyang. But his talents remained more political than
military, and he never won the respect which the army accorded to Choe
Yong Gun.</p>

<p>Among the corps commanders, there was none more able than Lieutenant
General Kim Ung. About 40 years old at the outbreak of war, he
had graduated from the Kumchon Commercial School in Korea and the
Whampoa Military Academy in China. As an officer of the 8th Route
Army, he won a reputation for daring in 1939 by tossing hand grenades
into a conference of Japanese generals at Peiping and escaping after inflicting
numerous casualties. Returning to Korea in 1946, he started as
a regimental commander and made a relatively slow rise because of his
CCF background. But after lining up with the Soviet faction in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
army, he was promoted to the command of the 1st Division in 1948 and
of I Corps during the invasion.</p>

<p>The rapid ascent of Lieutenant General Yu Kyong Su to the command
of III Corps would indicate that promotion was sometimes due to
political influence. A graduate of a Red Army tank school in 1938 at the
age of 33, Yu served throughout World War II as a company grade
officer in a Soviet tank unit. After his return to Korea, he married Kim Il
Sung’s sister and shot up from the command of an NK tank regiment
in 1948 to the rank of corps commander late in 1950. During the first
few weeks of the invasion, he was awarded the highest NKPA decoration,
the “Hero of the Korean Democratic People’s Republic,” with a
concurrent award, the “Order of the National Flag, 1st Class.”</p>

<p>On the other hand, the career of former Lieutenant General Kim Mu
Chong, ex-commander of II Corps and ex-chief of artillery, was blasted
by the opposition of Kim Il Sung and Nam Il. A CCF veteran, Mu had
served under Mao Tse-tung on the “Long March” as one of 30 Koreans
to survive the ordeal. He commanded a Chinese artillery brigade and
was rated the best CCF artilleryman. In 1945 he came back to Korea and
conducted a speaking tour stressing the desirability of cooperating with
Red China and omitting any reference to the Soviet Union. This lapse
explains his failure in North Korean politics, but in deference to his
high military reputation he was given command of II Corps in June
1950. The poor showing made by his units on the central front was
ascribed by Mu to the fact that Kim Il Sung picked him for missions
which could not succeed. Although he did not lack for support in the
army, Mu was relieved of his command and other positions in the late
summer of 1950. Expulsion from the North Korean Labor Party followed
after Kim Il Sung denounced him in a speech for disobedience of orders.</p>

<p>Mu’s downfall was only one chapter in the bitter struggle for power
waged by two opposing tactical schools in the North Korean army from
1948 to 1950. Veterans of CCF campaigns against the Japanese and
Chinese Nationalists upheld a system of large-scale guerrilla warfare
refined into a military science. Approach marches under cover of darkness,
infiltrations, probing night attacks—these were the basic tactics
employed by Mao Tse Tung’s forces for the conquest of China. Although
mobility was the keynote, a rigid tactical system allowed little latitude
of decision to officers below the regimental level. School solutions were
provided for every military problem that could be foreseen, and many of
the North Korean officers had graduated from the CCF military
academy at Yenan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
Another group of officers advocated the tactics learned at Soviet military
schools and in Soviet campaigns of World War II. This system, of
course, made the CCF tactics seem primitive in comparison. For the
Russians placed much more dependence in armor and artillery as preparation
for infantry envelopments. Such tactics called for more supplies
and ammunition than could have been provided by the elementary CCF
logistics.</p>

<p>The CCF veterans seemed to have the upper hand in the North
Korean army early in 1948. But a survey of NKPA officers’ careers
during the next 2 years indicates that their opponents triumphed. Thus,
at the onset of civil war, most of the key positions in the army were
filled by men who had hitched their wagons to the red star of Moscow,
both militarily and politically.</p>

<p>This does not mean that CCF tactics had been put aside entirely. On
the contrary, these methods had evolved out of military poverty and
were admirably adapted to an Asiatic peasant army. The North Korean
forces, being compelled to import arms, were never able to afford
enough planes, tanks, and artillery to make the best of the Soviet system.
And it was inevitable that heavy losses of such equipment in
combat would cause a reversion to CCF tactics.</p>

<h3><i>The NKPA Infantry Division</i></h3>

<p>No child ever bore a more striking likeness to its parent than did the
NKPA to the Soviet organization of World War II.</p>

<p>The army as a whole came under the overall control of General Headquarters
at Pyongyang, which planned and directed the invasion of ROK
territory. As the troops advanced, a Front Headquarters was set up to
control corps operations. This organization of Soviet origin was the
highest tactical echelon of command. Normally including three or four
corps of several divisions each, it resembled an army group in military
establishments of other nations. Front Headquarters had only a wartime
mission and could be disbanded in time of peace.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_30" href="#FNanchor_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> FECOM, ATIS, <cite>North Korean Forces</cite>, <i>op. cit.</i>, 3–13.</p></div>

<p>Next to the corps in the chain of command was the infantry division,
the basic tactical formation, modeled after that of the Red Army in
World War II. Of triangular design, numbering some 11,000 men, it
was reported by POW’s to consist of a headquarters, three rifle regiments,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
an artillery regiment, a signal battalion, an antitank battalion, a
training battalion, a reconnaissance troop, and such division rear services
as medical, veterinary, transport, and supply units.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_31" href="#FNanchor_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>Division Headquarters, with about 120 men, included the commander,
a major general, and officers of the division and special staff. Closely associated
with the CG, and possessing almost as much power and responsibility,
was the division political deputy, usually a senior colonel, who
supervised politico-military activities and reported any deviations from
doctrine. This was a peculiarly Communistic institution, of course, and
it was the duty of the deputy to see that officers and men of the division
remained well indoctrinated.</p>

<p>The NKPA rifle regiment, with a T/O strength of about 2,500 men,
consisted of 3 rifle battalions and supporting artillery. Each of these
battalions, numbering some 650 officers and men, included 3 rifle companies,
a heavy machinegun company, a mortar company, an antitank
gun platoon and an antitank rifle platoon in addition to signal, medical,
and supply platoons.</p>

<p>An NKPA rifle company, which had a T/O strength of about 150
men, was made up of a headquarters, 3 rifle platoons and a heavy machinegun
section. The rifle platoon had 4 squads and a T/O strength of
45 men. Squad weapons were said to include a light machinegun, a submachinegun
and Soviet M1891/30 rifles. Two hand grenades were
carried by each rifleman.</p>

<p>An army patterned after the Soviet system was certain to emphasize
artillery, and the NKPA artillery reserve at the outset of the invasion
consisted of 3 regiments—1 attached to GHQ, and 1 to each of the 2
corps operating at that time. But shortages of equipment and logistical
problems made it necessary in actual combat for the NKPA to concentrate
most of its artillery potential within the rifle division.</p>

<p>The organic artillery support of each division included a regiment
with a T/O total of approximately 1,000 men. Two 76-mm. gun battalions,
a 122-mm. howitzer battalion and a headquarters company numbered
some 250 men each. A battalion consisted of 3 firing batteries with
12 artillery pieces each, and personnel carried M1938 carbines.</p>

<p>There was also a self-propelled artillery battalion made up of 3 gun
companies, a signal platoon and a rear services section with a total of 16
SU-76 pieces. A lieutenant colonel commanded this unit, which had a
T/O strength of 110 officers and men.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
The other major components of the NKPA infantry division were as
follows:</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Signal Battalion.</span>—a wire company, radio company and headquarters
company, making a total of 260 officers and men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Antitank Battalion.</span>—about 190 officers and men in three 45-mm.
antitank companies and an antitank rifle company.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Engineer Battalion.</span>—T/O of 250 officers and men carrying M1944
rifles and equipped with picks, shovels, axes, saws and mine detectors.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Training Battalion.</span>—About 500 officers and men charged with
the responsibility of training NCO’s for the division.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Reconnaissance Company.</span>—an estimated strength of 4 officers and
90 enlisted men equipped with 80 submachineguns, 20 Tokarev pistols,
4 telescopes and 5 pairs of binoculars.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Rear Services.</span>—a medical battalion, a transport company, a veterinary
unit and a supply section. Of the 200 personnel in the medical battalion,
about 60 were women, according to POW testimony. The
transport company, with some 70 men, was composed of 50 2½-ton
trucks, 6 or 7 motorcycles and 10 horse-drawn wagons.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_32" href="#FNanchor_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>The NKPA infantry division, in short, was a faithful copy of the
World War II Soviet model. But it must be remembered that the foregoing
T/O and T/E statistics represented the ideal more often than the
reality. Owing to the speeding up of preparations in anticipation of an
easy victory, many NKPA units lacked their full quotas of men and
equipment at the outset of the invasion.</p>

<h3><i>NKPA Air and Armor</i></h3>

<p>POW interrogations revealed that NKPA military aviation evolved
from the North Korean Aviation Society, founded in 1945 at the Sinuiju
Airfield by Colonel Lee Hwal, a Korean who had served in the Japanese
air force. The organization consisted at first of about 70 students
and 17 pilots who were veterans of Japanese air operations. Equipment
included a few aircraft of Japanese manufacture and several gliders.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_33" href="#FNanchor_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> FECOM, ATIS, <cite>North Korean Air Force</cite> (InterRpt, Sup No. 100), 2–15.</p></div>

<p>In 1946 the Society was required to transfer its aircraft and trained
personnel to the Aviation Section of the Pyongyang Military Academy.
Soviet-trained Korean officers were placed in positions of responsibility<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
under the command of Colonel Wang Yun, a former captain in the
Soviet air force who replaced Lee Hwal.</p>

<p>The Aviation Section numbered about 100 officers, 250 enlisted men
and 500 students by November 1948. Estimates of aircraft are contradictory,
but one source reported 7 Japanese trainers, 6 Japanese fighters
and a Japanese twin-engine transport. Shortly afterwards the first Soviet
aircraft were received, and the NKPA Air Force was created from the
Aviation Section and moved to the Pyongyang air base.</p>

<p>The final phase of development came in January 1950 with the expansion
of the air regiment into a division under the command of
Wang Yun, promoted to major general. Strength of the unit in April
1950 was estimated at about 1,675 officers and men, including 364
officers, 76 pilots, 875 enlisted men, and 360 cadets. The receipt of more
Soviet planes at this time brought the number of aircraft up to 178, including
78 YAK-7B fighters, 30 PO-2 primary and YAK-18 advanced
trainers, and 70 Il-10 ground attack bombers.</p>

<p>Captured documents indicate that the aviation training program was
speeded up along with other NKPA activities during the last few
months before the invasion. In June 1950 each pilot was required to fly
40 training missions and attend 40 hours of lectures. As preparations for
the invasion neared completion, a forward displacement of tactical aircraft
was put into effect.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_34" href="#FNanchor_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>The North Korean armored division, a copy of its Soviet counterpart,
had only about half of the overall strength. Thus the NKPA 105th
Armored Division, comprising some 6,000 officers and men, included 3
medium tank regiments, the 107th, 109th, and 203d, with 40 tanks each.
Organic supporting units were the 206th Mechanized Infantry Regiment
and the 308th Armored Battalion equipped with self-propelled 76-mm.
guns. POW reports also mentioned reconnaissance, engineer, signal,
ordnance and medical battalions and a mixed unit identified as the 849th
Antitank Regiment, attached to the division after the invasion started.<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_35" href="#FNanchor_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> FECOM, ATIS, <cite>Enemy Forces</cite>, <i>op. cit.</i>, 27–32.</p></div>

<p>All reports indicate that the division was split in combat, with each
tank regiment being assigned to an infantry division. Even the training
of the regiments had been conducted separately, and there is no evidence
of prewar maneuvers on the division level.</p>

<p>Each tank regiment had an estimated T/O strength of about 600
officers and men. The three medium tank battalions were supported by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
a regimental submachinegun company, a supply and maintenance company
and a headquarters section in addition to engineer, signal, reconnaissance,
and medical platoons. Forty T-34/85 medium tanks were divided
into 13 for each battalion and 1 for the headquarters section, which
also rated a CAZ/67 jeep.</p>

<p>Responsibility for the indoctrination of the regiment rested with a
political section headed by a lieutenant colonel. As assistants he had 2
officers and 3 sergeants.</p>

<p>An NKPA tank battalion included a headquarters section and three
25-man companies. A company contained three platoons, each of which
was assigned a medium tank. The standard crew consisted of the commander,
usually a senior lieutenant, the driver and assistant driver, the
gunner in charge of the 85-mm. rifle, and the assistant gunner operating
the 7.62-mm. machinegun. The usual ammunition load was 55 85-mm.
shells and 2,000 rounds of machinegun ammunition.</p>

<p>Not much was known about the 206th Mechanized infantry Regiment,
but it was believed to consist of three motorized infantry battalions,
a 76-mm. howitzer battalion, a 45-mm. antitank battalion, a
120-mm. mortar battalion, a signal company, and an NCO training
company.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_36" href="#FNanchor_36" class="fnanchor">36</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<h3><i>NKPA Officer Procurement and Conscription</i></h3>

<p>Officer procurement problems were solved in large part by the fact that
thousands of North Koreans had seen combat service with the CCF
forces. Many of these veterans were qualified as junior officers or NCO’s
without further training. Remaining vacancies for company-grade officers
were filled by officer candidate schools or the commissioning of
qualified NCO’s.</p>

<p>The West Point of the NKPA, located at Pyongyang, turned out an
estimated 4,000 junior officers from the time of its activation in 1946 to
the beginning of the invasion. Courses normally ranged in length from
6 to 10 months, but were abbreviated to 3 months during the autumn
of 1949 in anticipation of the invasion. After hostilities began, the need
for replacement officers became so urgent that one entire class at the
Pyongyang academy was commissioned wholesale on 10 July 1950 and
sent to the front after 20 days of instruction.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_37" href="#FNanchor_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> FECOM, ATIS, <cite>North Korean Forces</cite>, <i>op. cit.</i>, 35–42.</p></div>

<p>Three Soviet officers, a colonel and two lieutenant colonels, reportedly
acted as advisers to a faculty composed of NKPA majors. The five departments
of the Academy were devoted to infantry, artillery, engineering,
signaling, and quartermasters’ duties.</p>

<p>A second military academy at Pyongyang specialized in subjects which
Communists termed “cultural.” So much importance was attached to
political indoctrination that graduates of this school were commissioned
as senior lieutenants and given unusual authority in their units. Although
a 2-year Russian language course was offered, most of the candidates
took the standard 9-month term.</p>

<p>Branches of the Pyongyang military academy were established as
officer candidate schools in Hamhung, Chinnampo, Chorwon, Mesanjin,
Kaechon and Kanggye. Applicants were required to have an acceptable
political background and a 6-year minimum of schooling, though the
last was sometimes waived.</p>

<p>A command and staff school at Pyongyang offered advanced tactical
and administrative courses at the battalion and regimental level to
selected officers. At the other extreme, NCO schools were located at
Sadong, Sinuiju, Sinchon and Nanam. Tactical instruction was given at
the platoon and squad level with emphasis on weapons courses. NCO
training was accelerated in preparation for hostilities, and 4,000 veterans
of CCF service in Manchuria completed 2-month courses at the Sadong
school alone in the spring of 1950.</p>

<p>Technical training in aircraft, artillery, tank and engineering specialties
was offered in schools for junior officers as well as enlisted men. But it
appears that most of the officers above the company level received their
instruction in Soviet schools.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_38" href="#FNanchor_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>Conscription, according to POW accounts, was introduced as early as
1948. In the rural districts each <em>myon</em> (a political subdivision smaller
than a county but comprising several villages) was given its quota of
recruits to be furnished between the ages of 18 and 35. The village chiefs
then assembled all the men in this age group and made their decisions
on an arbitrary basis. Selectees had little or no hope of appeal, but were
assured that provision would be made for their families during the 3-year
term of service.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_39" href="#FNanchor_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> <i>Ibid.</i>, 29–31.</p></div>

<p>The system was much the same in North Korean cities, which were
divided into sections for conscription purposes. Sometimes the leaders in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
urban areas called for volunteers. If the response was lacking in enthusiasm,
men were singled out and requested to “volunteer.” This method
was invariably successful, since a man who refused could be deprived of
employment.</p>

<p>The conscription program was speeded up along with other preparations
as invasion plans neared completion. About 12,000 men were
inducted from March through May 1950 and given 6 weeks of basic
training at such camps as the No. 2 People’s Training Center at Sinuiju.</p>

<p>In some communities the men eligible for military service were
requested to attend a meeting. Upon arrival, they were taken in trucks
to a training center and compelled to enlist.</p>

<p>Harsh as such methods might seem, they were gentle as compared to
the forced conscription of ROK civilians after the invasion got underway.
Both men and women in captured cities were crowded into school
buildings, given political indoctrination and forced to learn Communist
songs. After a week of this curriculum, the men were inducted both as
combat recruits and laborers. And though the women were told that
their service would be limited to duty as nurses or clerks, some of them
were coerced into carrying out reconnaissance or espionage missions.<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a></p>

<h3><i>The NKPA Order of Battle</i></h3>

<p>The transition from a cold war to a shooting war in Korea should not
have surprised anyone familiar with the events of the past 2 years. For
several hours, indeed, there was a reasonable doubt on the historic
morning of 25 June 1950 whether an undeclared war had begun or
merely another large-scale NKPA raid across the frontier.</p>

<p>But this time it was the real thing. Commencing at 0400, 7 infantry
divisions and an armored division swept across the 38th Parallel, with
2 infantry divisions in reserve. From right to left, the NKPA order of
battle was as follows:</p>

<p>The 6th Infantry Division along the west coast, sealing off the Ongjin
Peninsula and moving on Kaesong; the 1st Infantry Division advancing
on Kaesong and Seoul; the 4th and 3d Infantry Divisions and 105th
Armored Division attacking in west-central Korea and converging on
Seoul; the 2d and 15th Infantry Divisions driving toward the Hwachon-Chunchon
axis in east-central Korea; and the 5th Infantry Division taking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
the route along the east coast. Following close behind were the two
reserve infantry divisions, the 13th and 15th.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_41" href="#FNanchor_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> FECOM, ATIS, <cite>History of the North Korean Army</cite>, 25–27.</p></div>

<p>There was no question as to the outcome in the minds of observers
who knew the composition of the ROK army. The very name was misleading,
for it might more accurately have been described as a large
constabulary in process of being converted into an army. Given another
year of training and added arms and equipment, the Republic of Korea
would perhaps have built up an adequate defense establishment. But the
enemy took good care to strike while this development was still at the
blueprint stage.</p>

<p>In June 1949, at the conclusion of the occupation, the United States
forces turned over arms and equipment to the value of about
$110,000,000. These supplies included 100,000 small arms (rifles, pistols
and machineguns) and 50,000,000 rounds of ammunition; more than
4,900 vehicles of all types; about 2,000 2.36″ rocket launchers and 40,000
rounds of ammunition; and a large number of 105-mm. howitzers,
37-mm. and 57-mm. antitank guns, and 60-mm. and 81-mm. mortars,
together with 700,000 rounds of ammunition for those weapons. Twenty
training planes (L4 and L5 types) were transferred as well as 79 light
naval craft suitable for patrolling the coast.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_42" href="#FNanchor_42" class="fnanchor">42</a> U. S. Military Academy, Dept of Mil Art and Eng (U. S. MilAcad), <cite>Operations in
Korea</cite> (West Point, 1953), 4–5.</p></div>

<p>It is noteworthy that this list was limited to light arms for a constabulary
of about 50,000 men. Tanks, military aircraft and medium or heavy
artillery were significantly lacking.</p>

<p>At the request of the ROK government, a Korean Military Advisory
Group remained in South Korea after the conclusion of the American
occupation. Composed of 500 United States Army officers and enlisted
men, the KMAG took on the task of directing the training of a ROK
constabulary. The group was under the control of Ambassador Muccio,
since General MacArthur’s responsibility for the defense had ended
along with the occupation.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_43" href="#FNanchor_43" class="fnanchor">43</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>After the NKPA invasion, the United States was severely criticized in
some quarters for failing to provide the Republic of Korea with arms
and training equal to those of the enemy. American reluctance was due
in some measure to indiscreet declarations by that fiery old Korean patriot,
Syngman Rhee. The ROK president, 74 years old at the outbreak
of civil war, did not shrink from advocating the unification of Korea by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
armed force. On 20 February 1949 he predicted that his troops “could
defeat North Korea within 2 weeks” if the U. S. S. R. did not interfere.
Eight months later, on 7 October, his confidence had increased to the
point where he was “sure that we could take Pyongyang in 3 days.”<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_44" href="#FNanchor_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> A. Wigfall Green, <cite>Epic of Korea</cite> (Washington: Public Affairs Press, 1950), 125–26.</p></div>

<p>Such remarks placed the United States in an uncomfortable position.
If aid to the Republic of Korea were to include tanks, military aircraft
and training for offensive warfare, Americans would be open to the
charge of inciting civil strife. Communist propagandists would scream
that accusation in any event, of course, but there would be grounds for
the suspicion of other members of the United Nations. Ambassador
Muccio made sure, therefore, that United States assistance did not extend
beyond the legitimate needs of ROK frontier defense and internal
security.</p>

<p>The triangular ROK infantry division was modeled after the United
States unit but numbered about 9,500 troops. Eight divisions and a regiment
had been organized and partially trained by June 1950. They were
the 1st, 2d, 3d, 5th, 6th, 7th, 8th, and Capital Divisions and the 17th
Regiment.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> Only 4 of these divisions, the 1st, 2d, 6th, and 7th, had
their full complement of 3 regiments. All the others had 2 except the
5th, which had 2 and a battalion.<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_45" href="#FNanchor_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> The absence of a 4th Division is explained by an old Korean superstition. Because
the symbol for that number resembled the ancient symbol for death, it was regarded as
unlucky. Apparently the North Koreans managed to overcome this superstition, however,
in numbering their units.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_46" href="#FNanchor_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> LtCol Roy E. Appleman, USA, ms. history of UN operations in Korea, Jul–Nov 50.</p></div>

<p>ROK military strength was estimated at 98,808 troops by the KMAG
in June 1950. About 65,000 of them had been given unit training for
combat. They were fairly proficient in the employment of small arms
and mortars, but their instruction had not included defense against tanks.
Command and staff work were still at a rudimentary stage, and both
officers and NCO’s needed seasoning.</p>

<p>The ROK Army of June 1950 had made good progress, in short,
when it is considered that most of its components had been activated
within the past year. But it was no match for the Red Korean columns
which attacked at dawn on 25 June 1950. The ROK order of battle, if
such it could be called, consisted of a regiment and four infantry divisions
ranged from left to right across the peninsula—the 17th Regiment
and the 1st, 7th, 6th, and 8th Divisions. The remaining divisions were
dispersed for purposes of internal security: the Capital at Seoul; the 2d<span class="pagenum"><a class="hidep" id="Page_35">35</a><a id="Page_36">36</a></span>
at Chongju and Taejon; the 3d at Taegu; and the 5th at Kwangju.</p>

  <span class="smaller">25 JUNE 1950</span></div></div>

<p>The ROK frontier forces were not well disposed for defense in
depth. Taken by surprise, they put up an ineffectual resistance despite
brave fights here and there against odds. On other occasions the sight
of an enemy tank or armored car was enough to scatter ROK riflemen,
and the progress of the invading columns resembled an occupation
rather than an attack.</p>

<p>Before sundown on the day of invasion it appeared that NKPA leaders
had not erred in allowing a timetable of 10 days for overrunning the
Republic of Korea. The question now was whether the conflict could
be confined to that Asiatic peninsula. Communist aggressions were no
novelty, to be sure, either in Asia or Europe. But in the past there had
always been some show of peaceable intentions, however hypocritical,
or some shadow of legality. This was the first time that a Soviet puppet
nation had been permitted to go as far as open warfare. Matters had
come to a showdown, and it could only be interpreted as a challenge
issued by Communism to the free nations of the world.</p>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">At three o’clock</span> in the morning of 25 June 1950 the telephone rang
in the New York suburban home of Trygve Lie, secretary-general
of the United Nations. He was informed that North Korean forces had
crossed the 38th Parallel to invade the Republic of Korea.</p>

<p>The news had just been received by the United States Department of
State directly from Seoul. Ambassador Muccio had emphasized that this
was not one of the large-scale North Korean raids into ROK territory
which had become an old story during the past 2 years. For his report
concluded:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“It would appear from the nature of the attack and the manner in which it was
launched that it constitutes an all-out offensive against the Republic of Korea.”<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_47" href="#FNanchor_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> U. S. Dept of State, <cite>Guide to the U. N. in Korea</cite> (Washington: GPO, 1951).</p></div>

<p>The implications were disturbing. Every middle-aged American could
recall the failure of the League of Nations to halt Japanese, Italian, and
German aggressions of the 1930’s with moral suasions. Even when economic
sanctions were invoked, the aggressors went their way defiantly
without respect for anything short of armed force. And now history
seemed to be repeating itself with dismaying fidelity as new aggressors
challenged the new union of nations striving to maintain peace after
World War II.</p>

<p>There was even an ominous parallel in the fact that another civil conflict
in another peninsula had been the prelude to Armageddon in the
1930’s. For it might well have been asked if the Korea of 1950 were
destined to become the Spain of a new world war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
The answer of the United Nations was prompt and decisive. At 2
o’clock in the afternoon on 25 June 1950, a meeting of the Security
Council was called to order at New York. A dispatch had just been
received from UNCOK—the United Nations Commission on Korea—reporting
that four Soviet YAK-type aircraft had destroyed planes and
jeeps on an airfield outside of Seoul. The railway station in the industrial
suburb of Yongdungpo had also been strafed.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_48" href="#FNanchor_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>By a unanimous vote of nine member nations (with the U. S. S. R.
being significantly absent and Yugoslavia not voting) the blame for the
aggression was placed squarely upon the North Korean invaders. They
were enjoined to cease hostilities immediately and withdraw from ROK
territory.</p>

<p>The United Nations had no armed might to enforce its decisions. But
the Security Council did not intend to rely merely upon moral suasion
or economic sanctions. At a second meeting, on 27 June, the Council
proclaimed the NKPA attack a breach of world peace and asked member
nations to assist the Republic of Korea in repelling the invasion.</p>

<p>For the first time in the war-racked 20th century, a group of nations
banded together for peace had not only condemned an aggression but
appealed to armed force to smite the aggressor. On the same day that the
Security Council passed its historic resolution, the United States announced
that it was giving immediate military aid to the Republic of
Korea.</p>

<p>President Truman, as commander in chief, ordered American naval and
air forces into action. Fifty-two other members of the United Nations
approved the recommendations of the Security Council. Their pledges
of assistance included aircraft, naval vessels, medical supplies, field ambulances,
foodstuffs and strategic materials.</p>

<p>Only 3 of the 56 nations responding to the Council were opposed to
the majority decision. They were the Soviet Union and her two satellites,
Poland and Czechoslovakia, which had been brought into the Communist
orbit by compulsion after World War II.</p>

<p>On 29 June President Truman authorized General MacArthur to send
certain supporting United States ground force units to Korea. An American
naval blockade of the entire Korean coast was ordered, and Japan-based
Air Force planes were given authority to bomb specific military
targets north of the 38th Parallel.</p>

<p>These decisions were upheld by the wholehearted approval of nearly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
all Americans, according to contemporary newspapers.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> Virtually the
only dissenters were such left-wing extremists as the 9,000 who attended
a “Hands off Korea” rally held early in July 1950 under Communist
auspices in New York.<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> Barring such rule-proving exceptions, Americans
had long been smoldering with indignation at Soviet cold-war tactics.
They applauded the resolute stand taken by the United Nations,
and they were proud of their country for its response. Unfortunately,
they did not anticipate that anything more serious than a brief “police
action” would be necessary to settle affairs. Never in their wildest
imaginations had it occurred to them that an Asiatic peasant army might
be more than a match for all the United States ground forces in the Far
East.</p>

<h3><i>NKPA Gains of First Week</i></h3>

<p>It was by no means a contemptible army, judged even by Western military
standards, which ripped through ROK defenses after crossing the
38th Parallel. The major effort was the two-pronged attack on Seoul,
conducted with precision by the 1st NKPA Infantry Division, advancing
through Kaesong and Munsan while the 4th and 3d united south
of the frontier with elements of the 105th Armored to proceed by way
of the Yonchon-Uijongbu and Pochon-Uijongbu corridors.</p>

<p>On the right the 6th Infantry Division made short work of overrunning
the isolated Ongjin Peninsula and thrusting eastward toward
Kaesong. On the left the offensive was covered by the drive of the 2d
and 12th Infantry Divisions on Chunchon while the 5th made rapid
gains along the east coast.</p>

<p>In this area the North Koreans initiated the first amphibious operations
of the war with four Soviet-manufactured torpedo boats. Built
entirely of aluminum, of about 16 gross tons displacement when fully
loaded, these craft measured slightly over 19 meters in length and were
powered by two 10-Cylinder engines rated at 850 horsepower each. With
a crew of 8 men, a cruising speed of 20 to 25 knots and a range of 15
hours, the boats carried 2 torpedoes and were armed with a 12.7-mm.
heavy machinegun and 2 submachineguns.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_51" href="#FNanchor_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> FECOM, ATIS, <cite>North Korean Forces</cite>, <i>op. cit.</i>, 45–6.</p></div>

<p>During the first 5 days of the invasion, the 4 torpedo boats escorted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
convoys which transported NKPA troops down the east coast for unopposed
landings as far south as Samchok. But on 2 July 1950 the tiny
North Korean “navy” was almost literally blown out of the water when
it encountered UN Task Group 96.5 off Chuminjin while escorting 10
converted trawlers. With more bravery than discretion, the small North
Korean craft accepted battle with the American light cruiser <i>Juneau</i> and
two British warships, the light cruiser <i>Jamaica</i> and the frigate <i>Black
Swan</i>. Evidently the enemy hoped to score with a few torpedoes at the
cost of a suicidal effort, but the U. N. guns sank 2 of the aluminum
craft and drove a third to the beach, where it was soon destroyed along
with 7 of the convoy vessels. The North Koreans were credited with
“great gallantry” in the British dispatch after the fourth torpedo boat
escaped.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> But it was the last naval effort of any consequence by an enemy
strangled in the net of the UN blockade.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_52" href="#FNanchor_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> Capt Walter Karig, USN, <cite>Battle Report: The War in Korea</cite> (New York: Rinehart,
1952), 58–59.</p></div>

<p>On land the NKPA columns advanced almost at will during the first
4 days. Nearly a hundred tanks and as many planes were employed by
the two main columns advancing on Seoul, and on 27 June 1950 the
ROK seat of government was removed to Taejon while Far East Air
Force planes were evacuating United States citizens. ROK fugitives,
winding southward in an endless stream of humanity, choked every
road and multiplied the difficulties of the defense. To add to their
misery, one of the bridges across the river Han was blown prematurely
when masses of Koreans were crossing.</p>

<p>The fall of Seoul on the 28th ended the first stage of the offensive
as the NKPA forces halted for regrouping. Chunchon had surrendered
in east-central Korea, so that the invaders held a ragged line stretching
from Chumunjin on the east coast through Chunchon, Kapyong and
Seoul to the port of Inchon on the west coast.</p>

<p>The beaten and in some instances shattered ROK forces were meanwhile
falling back through Suwon in the hope of establishing new positions
of defense.</p>

<h3><i>Early United States Decisions</i></h3>

<p>A strategy of delaying actions was the only course open to General
MacArthur for the time being. One of his first decisions led to the establishment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
on 27 June of the GHQ Advanced Command Group at Suwon
under the command of Brigadier General John H. Church, USA. This
group had as its primary mission the reorganization of the demoralized
ROK forces, which were already reporting thousands of men missing in
action. Secondary missions were to keep Tokyo informed as to military
developments and expedite the delivery of supplies. As early as 27 June,
119 tons of emergency supplies had been sent to Korea by air, and an
additional 5,600 tons were being loaded on ships in Japan.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_53" href="#FNanchor_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> U. S. MilAcad, <i>op. cit.</i>, 7–8.</p></div>

<p>American naval and air forces lost no time at getting into action after
President Truman’s authorization. United States Naval Forces in the
Far East, under the command of Vice Admiral C. Turner Joy, had as
their principal element the Seventh Fleet, commanded by Vice Admiral
Arthur D. Struble. Its tactical organization, Task Force 77, immediately
clamped down a blockade on the Korean coast after wiping out enemy
naval opposition. Other warships of the Seventh Fleet were meanwhile
blockading Formosa to guard against the possibility of Chinese Communist
intervention by means of an attack on the last Nationalist
stronghold.</p>

<p>The United States Far East Air Forces, commanded by Lieutenant
General George E. Stratemeyer, USAF, consisted of eight and a half
combat groups responsible for the defense of Japan, Okinawa, Guam
and the Philippines. Primary missions assigned to the fighter and
bomber squadrons were the elimination of NKPA air opposition and
the retarding of enemy ground forces by means of interdictory air strikes
on bases and supply routes.</p>

<h3><i>Geography of Korea</i></h3>

<p>Geography being a first cousin of strategy, maps of Korea were almost
literally worth their weight in diamonds both in Tokyo and at the Pentagon.
For that matter, they were nearly as rare as diamonds, and it became
necessary in many instances to work with outdated Japanese maps.</p>

<p>On the map of Asia the Korean peninsula resembles a thumb dipping
down into the Yellow and Japan seas. For centuries it has been the sore
thumb of Asiatic power politics, so that trouble in Korea resulted in a
twinge being felt in the capitals of Europe. But small as Korea appears
on the map, it is actually about 575 miles in length—a peninsula<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
resembling Florida in shape but having about the area of Minnesota.</p>

<p>Variations in climate are comparable to the gradient from Maine to
Georgia along the Atlantic seaboard of the United States. Extremes
ranging from summer weather of 105° F. to winter temperatures of 40°
below zero have been recorded. A monsoon season of floods is to be
expected in July and August, followed by a period when typhoons are
a possibility. Altogether, it is a climate which can contribute no little
to the difficulties of a mechanized invader.</p>

<p>It would be almost an understatement to say that Korea is mountainous.
Few areas of the earth’s surface are so consistently rugged.
Bleak cliffs seem to thrust themselves dripping out of the sea on the
East Korean littoral. The peaks become higher and more perpendicular
as they march inland, until altitudes of 9,000 feet are reached.</p>

<p>The principal chain of mountains extends from the Yalu in the north
along the east coast to the Pusan area. Just south of the 38th parallel a
spur branches off diagonally to southwest Korea in the region of
Mokpu. The remainder of the peninsula consists largely of smaller
ranges and foothills.</p>

<p>The few broad valleys are found chiefly on the west coast, which has
a good many indentations and estuaries. Here also are most of Korea’s
large rivers, flowing west and south. Of little aid to navigation, these
streams are broad and deep enough to hamper military operations; and
in the monsoon season, floods become a menace.</p>

<p>As if the west coast were paying a penalty for being less mountainous,
mud flats and islands hamper navigation. And here the tides are among
the highest in the world, with an extreme range of about 30 feet existing
at Inchon in contrast to unusually moderate tides along the east
coast.</p>

<p>The west and south are the agricultural areas of Korea. Nothing is
wasted by peasants who till every inch of the lowland flats, rice paddies,
and terraced hills. Due to their back-breaking toil rather than many
natural advantages, Korea was able to export as much as half of its two
food staples, rice and fish, under the Japanese administration.</p>

<p>The population, estimated at 25,000,000 in 1945, increased both by
immigration and a high birth rate during the next 5 years until as many
as 29,000,000 inhabitants were claimed. Seoul was a capital of a million
and a half residents, and the two leading seaports, Pusan and Inchon,
had not far from a quarter of a million each. Modern office buildings,
factories and street railways were found in combination with muddy
streets and thatched huts on the outskirts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
A standard-gauge rail network, built largely by the Japanese, linked the
principal cities and connected in the north with the Manchurian railways.
The highway system was good for an Asiatic country but inadequate
for the purpose of an invader on wheels and tracks. Hard-surfaced
roads were few and far between, and the ordinary earth roads were
churned into bogs during the monsoon season. Air transportation was
limited to only a few large airfields and emergency landing facilities.</p>

<p>Altogether, Korea promised to be a tough nut to crack, when it came
to geography, for the officers poring over maps in Tokyo.</p>

<h3><i>United States Ground Forces in Korea</i></h3>

<p>The United States ground forces in the Far East comprised the understrength
7th, 24th, and 25th Infantry Divisions and the 1st Cavalry (dismounted)
Division of the Eighth United States Army, which had been
stationed in Japan since the end of World War II. These divisions had
only about 70 percent of their personnel, the regiments being limited to
two battalions.</p>

<p>The explanation of these deficiencies goes back to the end of World
War II. Popular clamor for the speedy discharge of the victorious
United States forces had resulted in American military sinews becoming
flabby during the next few years. Strenuous recruiting had been
necessary to maintain the small army of occupation in Japan at part
strength, and it was no secret that many of the men were attracted by
the expectation of travel and light occupation duties. The possibility of
battle had scarcely been anticipated when the invasion began, and combat
readiness left a good deal to be desired. Training on the company
level had been good on the whole, but both officers and men were
handicapped by the lack of maneuvers for units larger than a battalion.</p>

<p>Shortages in equipment were equally serious. There were not enough
mortars, recoilless rifles and other weapons even if there had been
enough maintenance parts and trained maintenance technicians. Most
of the arms, moreover, consisted of worn World War II equipment
which had seen its best days. Finally, the divisional armored units had
been provided with light M-24 tanks, instead of the heavier machines
normally employed, because of the weak bridges in Japan.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></p>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_54" href="#FNanchor_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> U. S. MilAcad, <i>loc. cit.</i></p></div>

<p>It was, in brief, an unprepared and ill-equipped little army of<span class="pagenum"><a class="hidep" id="Page_44">44</a><a id="Page_45">45</a></span>
occupation which represented the first line of United States defense in
the Far East.</p>

<p>On 2 July the advance elements of the 24th Infantry Division, commanded
by Major General William F. Dean, were flown from Japan to
Korea. Two days later, on the American national holiday, the first contact
of the United States ground forces with the enemy was made near
Osan, about 8 miles south of Suwon.</p>

<p>The American force consisted of 2 infantry companies, a battery of
artillery, two 4.2″ mortar platoons, a platoon of 75-mm. recoilless rifles,
and six 2.36″ rocket-launcher teams. Named Task Force Smith after its
commanding officer, Lieutenant Colonel Charles B. Smith, the first
United States contingent collided on the morning of 5 July with a whole
NKPA division supported by 30 T-34 tanks. Despite the odds against
it, Task Force Smith put up a good delaying fight of 4 or 5 hours before
pulling out with the loss of all equipment save small arms.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_55" href="#FNanchor_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> 24th InfDiv, Supporting Documents, 24 Jul-16 Aug 50, 6–7.</p></div>

<p>On 7 July, the UN Security Council passed a resolution calling for
a unified command in Korea, and President Truman named General
MacArthur as commander in chief. Lieutenant General Walton H.
Walker, who had been one of Patton’s best officers in World War II,
was appointed commander of the Eighth United States Army in Korea
(EUSAK) on 12 July, and 4 days later he assumed control of all ROK
ground forces.</p>

<p>The ROK army, as might be supposed, was badly battered and much
in need of reorganization. At the end of the first week of invasion, the
ROK missing in action had reached a total of about 34,000. Whole battalions
had been scattered like chaff, yet it speaks well for the spirit of
the troops that most of the missing eventually returned to their units.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a>
The odds against them had made it a hopeless fight, but these Korean
soldiers would give a good account of themselves when they had better
training and equipment.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_56" href="#FNanchor_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> Appleman, <i>op. cit.</i></p></div>

<p>The United States forces were finding it hard sledding, for that matter.
The remaining units of the 24th Infantry Division were in action by
7 July, having arrived by sea from Japan. They were followed by the
25th Infantry Division, commanded by Major General William B.
Kean, which completed the movement to Korea on 14 July.</p>

<p>These first outweighed United States forces had no choice except to
trade space for time in a series of delaying actions. Although the units<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
had to be employed piecemeal at first, they slowed up the main thrust
of the enemy—the advance of three NKPA divisions, well supported by
armor, down the Seoul-Taejon axis.</p>

<p>Seldom in history have American forces ever endured a worse ordeal
by fire. Unprepared morally as well as materially, snatched from soft
occupation duties in Japan, they were suddenly plunged into battle
against heavier battalions. The “Land of the Morning Calm” was to
them a nightmare land of sullen mountains and stinking rice paddies.
There was not even the momentary lift of band music and flag waving
for these occupation troops, and they were not upheld by the discipline
which stiffens the spines of old regulars.</p>

<p>Considering what they were up against, the soldiers of the 24th and
25th have an abiding claim to a salute from their countrymen. They
fought the good fight, even though they could keep militarily solvent
only by withdrawals between delaying actions.</p>

<p>Officers as well as men were expendables in this Thermopylae of the
rice paddies. Because of the large proportion of green troops, colonels
and even generals literally led some of the counterattacks in the 18th-century
manner. Colonel Robert R. Martin, commanding the 34th Infantry
of the 24th Division, fell in the thick of the fighting while rallying
his troops. General Dean stayed with his forward units, personally
firing one of the new 3.5″ bazookas until the enemy broke through. He
was reported missing for months, but turned up later as the highest
ranking United States military prisoner of the conflict in Korea.</p>

<p>American light tanks could not cope with the enemy’s T-34’s; and
even when the first few medium tanks arrived, they were equipped only
with 75-mm. guns against the heavier NKPA armament. Not until the
third week of ground force operations, moreover, did the United States
artillery units receive 155-mm. howitzers to supplement their 105’s.</p>

<p>There was nothing that the ground forces could do but withdraw toward
the line of the river Kum. Here a stand was made by 24th Division
units at Taejon, an important communications center. But the enemy
managed to establish bridgeheads, and the fall of the town on 20 July
marked the end of the first phase.</p>

<p>Two days later the 24th Division, now commanded by General
Church, was relieved south of Taejon by Major General Hobart R. Gay’s
1st Cavalry (dismounted) Division, which had landed at Pohang-dong
on the 18th. And on 26 July the separate 29th Infantry RCT disembarked
at Chinju on the south coast after a voyage from Okinawa.</p>

<p>The reinforced Eighth Army was still too much outnumbered to vary<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
its strategy of delaying actions with sustained counterattacks. While the
new American units and the 25th Division fell slowly back toward the
line of the Naktong, the regrouped ROK divisions were assigned sectors
toward the north and east, where a secondary NKPA offensive
threatened Pohang-dong. Meanwhile, the exhausted 24th Division went
into Eighth Army reserve.</p>

<p>The ground forces would doubtless have been in a worse situation if
it had not been for hard-hitting United States naval and air support.
Major General Emmett O’Donnell’s B-29 Superforts of the FEAF
Bomber Command took off from Japanese bases to fly strikes on enemy
supply routes, communications hubs, marshaling yards and other strategic
targets all the way back to the Yalu.</p>

<p>Task Force 77, ranging along the west coast, gave Pyongyang its first
large-scale bombing on 3 July. Gull-winged F4U Corsairs, leading off
from the <i>Valley Forge</i> flight deck with 5-inch rockets, were followed by
AD Skyraiders and new Douglas dive bombers. Bridges and railway
yards were destroyed by raiders who shot down two YAK-type planes in
the air and destroyed two on the ground.</p>

<p>Along the east coast the <i>Juneau</i> and other warships of the Anglo-American
blockading force patrolled the enemy’s MSR, which followed
the shoreline. Salvos from the cruisers, fired at the sheer cliffs, loosed
avalanches of earth and rock to block the highway. Railways were mined
and tunnels dynamited by commando parties landing from ships’ boats.</p>

<p>The combined U. N. efforts inflicted heavy material and personnel
losses while slowing up the NKPA offensive. But it is a testimonial to
Soviet and Red Korean preparations for aggression that the army of invasion
kept on rolling. There was even some prospect late in July that
the enemy would yet make good his boast of being able to take Pusan
within 2 months in spite of United States intervention.</p>

<h3><i>Requests for United States Marines</i></h3>

<p>Upholding their long tradition as America’s force-in-readiness, the Marines
have usually been among the first troops to see action on a foreign
shore. Thus it might have been asked what was holding them back at a
time when Army troops in Korea were hard-pressed.</p>

<p>The answer is that the Marines actually were the first United States
ground forces to get into the fight after completing the long voyage
from the American mainland. There were no Marine units of any size<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
in the Far East at the outset of the invasion. But not an hour was lost
at the task of assembling an air-ground team at Camp Pendleton,
California, and collecting the shipping.</p>

<p>The spirit of impatience animating the Marine Corps is shown by an
entry on the desk calendar of General Clifton B. Cates under the date of
26 June 1950. This was the day after the news of the invasion reached
Washington, and the Commandant commented:</p>

<p>“SecNav’s policy meeting called off. Nuts.”<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_57" href="#FNanchor_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> Gen Clifton B. Cates ltr to authors, 7 Apr 54 (Cates, 7 Apr 54).</p></div>

<p>On the 28th General Cates had his first conference with Admiral Forrest
P. Sherman, Chief of Naval Operations. He noted on his calendar
the next day: “Recommended to CNO and SecNav that FMF be employed.”
Two days later General Cates “attended SecNav’s conference.”
And on 3 July his calendar recorded more history:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Attended JCS meeting. Orders for employment of FMF approved.”<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_58" href="#FNanchor_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>The steps leading up to this decision may be traced back to the conference
of 28 June, when Cates gave Sherman a summary of the strength
of the Marine Corps. Along with other branches of the service, it had
taken cuts in appropriations since World War II, so that total numbers
were 74,279 men on active duty—97 percent of authorized strength. The
Fleet Marine Force had a strength of 27,656—11,853 in FMFPac (1st
Marine Division, Reinf., and 1st Marine Aircraft Wing) and 15,803 in
FMFLant (2d Marine Division, Reinf., and 2d Marine Aircraft Wing).<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a></p>

(Washington, HQMC, G-3, HistSec, 1951), 1–2.</p></div>

<p>Neither of these understrength divisions, General Cates pointed out,
could raise much more than an RCT of combat-ready troops with supporting
air.</p>

<p>Admiral Sherman asked CinCPacFlt on 1 July how long it would take
to move (<i>a</i>) a Marine BLT and (<i>b</i>) a Marine RCT from the Pacific
Coast. Admiral Radford replied the next day that he could load the BLT
in 4 days and sail in 6; and that he could load the RCT in 6 days and
sail in 10.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a></p>

<p>Next, a dispatch from CNO to Admiral C. Turner Joy announced
that a Marine RCT could be made available if General MacArthur desired
it. COMNAVFE called personally on the general, who had just
returned from a depressing inspection of the invasion front. Not only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
did CINCFE accept immediately, but he showed unusual enthusiasm in
expressing his appreciation.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a></p>

<p>Sunday 2 July was the date of the message from General MacArthur
requesting the immediate dispatch of a Marine RCT with supporting
air to the Far East. CNO acted that same day. With the concurrence of
JCS and the President, he ordered Admiral Radford to move a Marine
RCT with appropriate air to the Far East for employment by General
MacArthur.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a></p>

CINCFE, 3 Jul 50.</p></div>

<p>Later, when General Cates asked CNO how the historical decision
had been accomplished, Admiral Sherman replied cryptically in baseball
language, “From Cates to Sherman, to Joy, to MacArthur, to JCS!”<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a></p>

<h3><i>Activation of the Brigade</i></h3>

<p>Even at this early date there was talk both in Washington and Tokyo
of forming an entire Marine division after mobilizing the Reserve.
For the present, however, it sufficed to organize the RCT requested
by General MacArthur. There could be little doubt that the assignment
would be given to an air-ground team built around the two
main West Coast units, the 5th Marines and Marine Aircraft Group 33.
They were activated along with supporting units on 7 July as the 1st
Provisional Marine Brigade, commanded by Brigadier General Edward
A. Craig, senior officer at Camp Pendleton. The air component, consisting
of three squadrons of MAG-33, was placed under the command
of Brigadier General Thomas H. Cushman, who was named deputy
commander of the Brigade.</p>

<p>Lieutenant General Lemuel C. Shepherd, Jr., commanding general of
FMFPac, and a G-3 staff officer, Colonel Victor H. Krulak, had been
ordered on 4 July to proceed immediately to Tokyo and confer with
General MacArthur. Before leaving, Shepherd found time to recommend
formation of third platoons for rifle companies of the 5th Marines, and
CNO gave his approval the following day.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_64" href="#FNanchor_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> CNO disp to CinCPacFlt, 5 Jul 50.</p></div>

<p>Unfortunately, there was not enough time to add third rifle companies<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
to the battalions of the 5th Marines which had been training with two
companies on a peacetime basis. Camp Pendleton and its neighboring
Marine Air Station, El Toro, hummed with day and night activity as the
Brigade prepared to sail in a week. Weapons and clothing had to be issued,
immunization shots given, and insurance and pay allotments made
out. Meanwhile, telegrams were sent to summon Marines from posts
and stations all over the United States.</p>

<p>Among these Marines were the first helicopter pilots of the United
States Armed Forces to be formed into a unit for overseas combat service.
Large-scale production of rotary-wing aircraft had come too late to
have any effect on the tactics of World War II, though a few Sikorsky
machines had been used experimentally both in the European and Pacific
theaters toward the end of the conflict. But it remained for the
United States Marine Corps to take the lead in working out combat
techniques and procedures after organizing an experimental squadron,
HMX-1, at Quantico in 1947.</p>

<p>Seven pilots, 30 enlisted men and 4 HO3S-1 Sikorsky 2-place helicopters
were detached from HMX-1 on 8 July 1950 for service with the
Brigade. Upon arrival at El Toro, these elements were combined with 8
fixed-wing aircraft pilots, 33 enlisted men and 8 OY planes to form the
Brigade’s air observation squadron, VMO-6.</p>

<p>This is an example of how units were assembled at Pendleton and El
Toro. Major Vincent J. Gottschalk, appointed commanding officer of
VMO-6 on 3 July, had orders to ready his squadron for shipment overseas
by the 11th. Thus he had just 48 hours, after the arrival of the
Quantico contingent, in which to weld the elements of his outfit together.
Among his other problems, Gottschalk had to grapple with the
fact that there were not enough OY’s in good condition at El Toro. He
found a solution by taking eight of these light observation planes overseas
with a view to cannibalizing four of them for parts when the need
arose.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

book is devoted entirely to the operations of the U. S. Marine helicopter units organized
from 1947 to 1953 for service both in the United States and overseas.</p></div>

<p>There was not enough time in most instances for weapons familiarization
training. Company A of the 1st Tank Battalion had been accustomed
to the M4A3 Medium tank with either the 75-mm. gun or the
105-mm. howitzer. Activated on 7 July for service with the Brigade, the
unit was equipped with M-26 “Pershing” tanks and 90-mm. guns. Captain
Gearl M. English, the commanding officer, managed to snatch 1 day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
in which to take his men to the range with 2 of the new machines. Each
gunner and loader was limited to 2 rounds, and the 90-mm. guns
were never fired again until they were taken into combat in Korea.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a></p>

Marine Brigade (Brig) SAR, 2 Aug-6 Sep 50.</p></div>

<p>Support battalions were cut down to company size, generally speaking,
for service with the Brigade. Thus Company A of the 1st Motor
Transport Battalion numbered 6 officers and 107 men; and Company A
of the 1st Engineer Battalion (reinf.) totaled 8 officers and 209 men.</p>

<p>The largest unit of the ground forces, of course, was the 5th Marines
with 113 officers and 2,068 men commanded by Lieutenant Colonel
Raymond L. Murray. Next came the 1st Battalion (reinf.) of the 11th
Marines, numbering 37 officers and 455 men under the command of
Lieutenant Colonel Ransom H. Wood.</p>

<p>Altogether, according to a report of 9 July 1950, the Brigade ground
forces reached a total of 266 officers and 4,503 men.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a></p>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_67" href="#FNanchor_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> CinCPacFlt disp to CINCFE, 9 Jul 50.</p></div>

<p>On this same date, the Brigade’s air component amounted to 192 officers
and 1,358 men. The principal units were as follows:</p>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_68" href="#FNanchor_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>Adding the ground force and air figures gives a grand total of 6,319—458
officers and 5,861 men—on 9 July 1950. Before sailing, however,
the activation of third rifle platoons and the last-minute attachment of
supporting troops brought the strength of the Brigade and its air components
up to 6,534.</p>

<p>Most of the equipment came from the great Marine supply depot at
Barstow in the California desert. Here were acres of “mothballed”
trucks, jeeps, DUKW’s and amphibian tractors dating back to World
War II. It has been aptly remarked, in fact, that “there were more veterans
of Iwo and Okinawa among the vehicles than there were among
the men who would drive them.”<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a></p>

out of the Brigade from Camp Pendleton.</p></div>

<p>Rail and highway facilities were taxed to the limit by the endless
caravan of equipment moving from Barstow to Pendleton and El Toro<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
after being hastily reconditioned and tested. Not all the arms were of
World War II vintage, however, and the Marines of the Brigade were
among the first American troops to be issued the new 3.5″ rocket
launcher.</p>

<h3><i>Brigade Leadership</i></h3>

<p>It appeared to be a scene of mad confusion at Pendleton as Marines
arrived hourly by train, bus, and plane. But the situation was kept well
in hand by General Craig, who had seen many other departures for
battle during his 33 years in the Corps. Born in Connecticut and educated
at the St. Johns Military Academy, Delafield, Wis., he was commissioned
a Marine second lieutenant in 1917 at the age of 21. Throughout the
next 3 decades he served with distinction both as a line and staff officer,
and both as student and instructor at the Marine Corps Schools.</p>

<p>During World War II he was executive and later commanding officer
of the 9th Marine Regiment, which he led in the landing at Empress
Augusta Bay on Bougainville and the recapture of Guam in the
Marianas. Awarded the Bronze Star and Navy Cross for gallantry in
these operations, Craig became operations officer of the V Amphibious
Corps in time to help plan the Iwo Jima operation. After the war he returned
to Guam for 2 years in 1947 to command the 1st Provisional
Marine Brigade, Fleet Marine Force, before becoming ADC to Major
General Graves B. Erskine, CG 1st Marine Division, in 1949.</p>

<p>The white hair and slender, erect figure of the dynamic Brigade commander
would soon become a familiar sight to every platoon leader at
the front. His assistant, General Cushman, was born in St. Louis, Mo.
in 1895 and attended the University of Washington. Enlisting in the
Marine Corps shortly after the outbreak of World War I, he completed
flight training and was designated a naval aviator. Subsequent tours of
aviation duty in Haiti, Nicaragua, and Guam were varied with assignments
as instructor at Pensacola and administrative officer with BuAer
in Washington. Cushman was a wing commander in World War II and
was awarded a Bronze Star and Legion of Merit while serving in that
capacity and later as chief of staff to the CG of Marine Aircraft Wings,
Pacific. After the war he became commander of the Marine Corps Air
Bases and CG of Aircraft, FMFPac.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Murray, CO of the 5th Marines, was born in Los
Angeles in 1913. He graduated from Texas A. and M. College in 1935<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
and was commissioned a Marine second lieutenant. After prewar service
in China and Iceland, he became a troop leader in three of the hardest-fought
Marine operations of World War II—Guadalcanal, Tarawa, and
Saipan. Awarded the Navy Cross, two Silver Stars, and the Purple Heart
medal, Murray made a name for heroism that was noteworthy even in
Marine circles.</p>

<p>This was no light achievement, for both CMC and CG FMFPac—General
Cates and General Shepherd—had distinguished themselves as
Marine combat leaders. Both were wounded in Marine operations of
World War I, and both won later honors during Caribbean actions of the
Marine Corps.</p>

<p>On 11 July, as Brigade preparations for sailing neared a climax,
General Shepherd sent the first report of his visit to Korea. He and
Colonel Krulak had held conferences with General MacArthur, Admiral
Joy and Rear Admiral James H. Doyle, commanding Amphibious
Planning Group 1. The commander in chief, said Shepherd, already envisioned
a great amphibious operation with a complete Marine division
and air components as his landing force. Not only was he “enthusiastic,”
about the employment of Marines, but he believed in the necessity for
employing them as an air-ground team.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_70" href="#FNanchor_70" class="fnanchor">70</a> CG FMFPac memo for record, “Visit to Far East Command,” 11 Jul 50.</p></div>

<p>MacArthur was “not sanguine” about the situation in Korea. He felt
that the nature of enemy resistance, combined with the rugged terrain
and the possibilities of Soviet or Red Chinese intervention, threatened
to protract operations. Thus he favored a Marine amphibious landing
far in the enemy’s rear to cut off and destroy the North Korean columns
of invasion.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_71" href="#FNanchor_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>General Shepherd’s report made it seem likely, just before the Brigade
sailed, that its units would probably be absorbed soon into a Marine
division with an amphibious mission. For the present, however, it was
enough to start the movement from Pendleton and El Toro to San
Diego, where the convoy awaited. MAG-33 had orders to embark in the
transports <i>Anderson</i> and <i>Achernar</i> and the carrier (CVE-116) <i>Badoeng
Strait</i>. The ground forces would make the voyage in the LSD’s <i>Fort
Marion</i> and <i>Gunston Hall</i>, the AKA’s <i>Alshain</i> and <i>Whiteside</i>, and the
APA’s <i>Pickaway</i>, <i>Clymer</i> and <i>Henrico</i>.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>General Cates was on hand at the docks from 12 to 14 July when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
the Brigade sailed. His long cigarette holders were famous, and no
second lieutenant in the Corps could throw a more military salute. As
he eyed the ground forces filing past, the Commandant could only have
felt that Marine traditions would be upheld. A good many of the PFC’s,
it is true, were too young to have seen action in World War II, though
nearly all had been well grounded in fundamentals. Perhaps at the front
they might become victims at first of their own over-anxiety. But they
would doubtless grin sheepishly about it afterwards and become combat-hardened
in a short time.</p>

<p>A glance at the NCO’s, the platoon leaders and company commanders
of the Brigade could only have brought a gleam of pride to the Commandant’s
battlewise eye. With few exceptions, they were veterans of
World War II who could be relied upon to get the best out of their men.
And it may be that the Commandant was reminded of the remark attributed
to General William T. Sherman during the Civil War:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“We have good corporals and sergeants and some good lieutenants and captains,
and those are far more important than good generals.”<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Nobody could give a more smooth and eloquent talk than General
Cates before a Washington audience. But when it came to saying
farewell to the Brigade troops, he addressed them in the language of
Marines.</p>

<p>“You boys clean this up in a couple of months,” said the Commandant,
“or I’ll be over to see you!”<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></p>

</div>

<p class="chapsmy"><i>Conference With CINCFE—The Washington Scene—The Advance
Party in Japan—Voyage of the Brigade—The Advance Party in
Korea—Crisis of the Eighth Army</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">As the ships</span> of the Brigade vanished over the horizon, Generals Craig
and Cushman rushed to complete final administrative details at
their respective West Coast bases. Then, in the early morning of 16
July, the advance party, consisting of the two commanders and parts
of their staffs, boarded a transport plane at the Marine Corps Air Station,
El Toro, and began the long journey westward.</p>

<p>The first stop was Pearl Harbor, T. H., island “Pentagon” of America’s
vast defensive network in the Pacific. On arrival, Craig and Cushman
immediately reported to General Shepherd. In company with him, the
two visitors called briefly on Admiral Radford. Later, Shepherd, his staff,
and the advance party met at Fleet Marine Force Headquarters for a
conference on the problems incident to the Marine commitment in
combat.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_75" href="#FNanchor_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> LtGen E. A. Craig ltr to authors, 25 Jan 54 (Craig, 25 Jan 54).</p></div>

<p>The Brigade commander painted a vivid picture of his provisional
fighting force, stressing both its potential and its handicaps. He repeatedly
emphasized the necessity for the addition of a third rifle company
to each infantry battalion. With equal fervor he spoke of the need
for two more 105-mm. howitzers in each battery of his artillery battalion.
He told how the Brigade had been forced to leave behind much of its
motor transport because of limited shipping space, and he requested that
replacement vehicles be provided as soon as possible.</p>

<p>His presentation was not falling on deaf ears; for combat-wise officers
knew only too well how such shortages would restrict the maneuverability,
firepower, and mobility of the Brigade. Finally, Craig repeated his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
earlier request that steps be taken immediately to provide for monthly
replacement drafts of 800 men. If the peace-strength Marine unit were
committed to combat in the near future, he said, it could ill afford to
watch its already thin ranks dwindle indefinitely.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>Leaving behind a maze of support and reinforcement problems for
FMFPac Headquarters, the Brigade advance party boarded its plane and
set out for Japan. On 19 July the big aircraft discharged its passengers
at the Haneda Airport, near Tokyo. General Craig immediately reported
to his naval superior, Admiral Joy. Later the Brigade commander, General
Cushman, and the other officers of the advance party, assembled at
General Headquarters, Far East, where they would get their first glimpse
of the war through the eyes of the United States Army.</p>

<p>They conferred first with Major General Edward A. Almond, USA,
and Brigadier General Edwin K. Wright, USA. The former was Chief of
Staff to General MacArthur, while the latter served as G-3 on the staff.
After Almond and Wright had received a report on the organization
and capabilities of the Brigade air-ground team, they ushered the two
Marine generals into the office of MacArthur.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></p>

<h3><i>Conference With CINCFE</i></h3>

<p>The commander in chief greeted his visitors cordially and expressed his
pleasure at having Marines in his command again. He commented briefly
on the excellence of the 1st Marine Division and certain Marine air
units which had served under him during World War II. The general
smiled as he mentioned a rumor to the effect that he had been prejudiced
against Marines during the Pacific War. Sweeping aside this tale as being
unfounded, he said that he had always held the greatest admiration for
the Corps and would welcome its units to his command any time.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_78" href="#FNanchor_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> Craig, 25 Jan 54.</p></div>

<p>Following this reception, MacArthur meticulously briefed Craig and
Cushman on the critical situation in Korea, where the war was already
entering its fourth week. The commander in chief disclosed his tentative
plans for commitment of the Marines: he would hold the Brigade
in Japan as a force in readiness until an entire Marine division could be
assembled. If he could have this division by September, he intended to
launch an amphibious assault against the port of Inchon on the west<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
coast. Striking deep in the Communist rear, he would sever the long
lines of communications linking North Korean bases to the Communist
invaders at the front. Thus isolated, the latter would quickly wither, and
Walker’s Eighth Army could smash out of the Pusan Perimeter.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_79" href="#FNanchor_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> <i>Ibid.</i>; and Brig SAR, 2 Aug-6 Sep 50, basic rpt.</p></div>

<p>When MacArthur concluded, he and Craig discussed the organization
of the Brigade. The Marine general emphasized that his command was
an air-ground team; and though few in numbers, the Brigade had a
powerful potential if its air arm remained integral. MacArthur assured
him that the Marine combination would remain intact, unless some
emergency dictated otherwise.</p>

<p>Craig next mentioned that the infantry and artillery units of the
Brigade were at peace strength. MacArthur was surprised to learn that
each battalion had just 2 rifle companies, and each battery only 4 guns
instead of 6. He was even more surprised to find that each of the 6 infantry
companies had 50 men less than the number called for in Marine
war tables. The Army leader had been aware of certain shortages when
he sent a message to the Pentagon on 10 July, requesting the Joint
Chiefs of Staff to authorize expansion of the Brigade to a full war-strength
division.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> He believed at the time, however, that the Brigade
itself would be formed on a wartime basis. Now, confronted with reality,
he ordered his chief of staff to prepare another dispatch to the Joint
Chiefs, asking that the Brigade be expanded to full war strength and
reiterating his request for an entire division.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a></p>

<p>MacArthur concluded the conference by informing Craig that the
Marine fighting team would remain in Japan under operational control
of Joy’s headquarters. This was good news to the Brigade commander.
Being attached to the Naval command meant that his Marines would be
free to train and otherwise prepare for their future amphibious mission;
whereas an assignment to the Eighth Army’s rear echelon might have
entailed time-consuming occupational and administrative duties.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></p>

<h3><i>The Washington Scene</i></h3>

<p>Although the solution to Marine Corps problems had seemed simple
enough in MacArthur’s office, it was quite another story on the other<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
side of the world in Washington. The Joint Chiefs of Staff had rendered
no decision on the general’s 10 July request for a Marine division. Nevertheless,
General Cates ordered his staff to draw up detailed plans for
expansion so that immediate action could be taken if authorization were
forthcoming. As a result, Plans Able and Baker were prepared, the one
designed to augment the Brigade to war strength, the other to explore
the requirements for creating a full division. To cover these possibilities
together with the Corps’ other irrevocable commitments throughout
the world, Marine planners were drawn more and more toward a single
basic conclusion—if President Truman and the Joint Chiefs of Staff
granted MacArthur’s request, the Marine Corps Reserve would have to
be mobilized at once.</p>

<p>When the Joint Chiefs received the message which MacArthur had
dictated in General Craig’s presence, they requested an estimate from
the Marine Corps on how long it would take to form a war-strength
division. General Cates summed up his case: the Marine Corps, numbering
only 74,279 officers and men,<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> was committed on a global basis.
There was a brigade on its way to Korea, a peace-strength division on
the Atlantic Coast,<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> and a battalion landing team permanently assigned
to the Mediterranean Fleet. There were detachments of Marines assigned
for domestic security, shipboard duty, and overseas security. Moreover,
in order to carry out any expansion program on a sound basis, it would
be necessary to maintain cadres of experienced personnel in various
training centers. The Commandant’s presentation made it clear that any
immediate expansion would, as proved by simple arithmetic, be
dependent upon mobilization of the Reserve.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_83" href="#FNanchor_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> Figure as of 30 Jun 1950.</p></div>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_84" href="#FNanchor_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> The 2d Marine Division, Camp Lejeune, N. C.</p></div>

<p>Accordingly, the Joint Chiefs of Staff recommended to President
Truman that the Organized Marine Corps Reserve be called to active
duty. That same morning, 19 July, Admiral Sherman notified General
Cates of this decision. The Commandant lost no time at ordering his
staff to alert all Reserve units. His grounds for haste were well founded;
for in the afternoon a presidential proclamation announced that the
“citizen-Marines” would be mobilized. The following day Cates called
CNO and submitted Plans Able and Baker, the proposed procedures for
building both the Brigade and 1st Marine Division to war strength.</p>

<p>In the meantime JCS had notified MacArthur that his request could
not be granted until late fall “without unacceptable weakening [of] the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
Fleet Marine Force Atlantic.”<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> When the U. N. commander received
this message, he countered immediately with the reply:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“... Most urgently request reconsideration of decision with reference to First
Marine Division. It is an absolutely vital development to accomplish a decisive
stroke and if not made available will necessitate a much more costly and longer
operational effort both in blood and expense.</p>

<p>“It is essential the Marine Division arrive by 10 September 1950 as requested.
While it would be unwise for me to attempt in this message to give in detail the
planned use of this unit I cannot emphasize too strongly my belief of the complete
urgency of my request. There can be no demand for its potential use elsewhere that
can equal the urgency of the immediate battle mission contemplated for it.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></p>

<p class="sigright">
“Signed MacArthur”
</p></blockquote>

<p>On 22 July the gears of mobilization were already enmeshed. Taking
this into account along with the urgency of MacArthur’s last communication,
the Joint Chiefs showed the first signs of relenting in their reply
to Tokyo. This time they informed the Army general that they were
reconsidering his problem, but added that he must advise them of the
proposed employment of the Brigade up to 10 September and the possibility
of adjusting that deadline. The same message carried the encouraging
news that a directive had already been issued to bring both the
Brigade and its air group to full war strength.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>In answer, MacArthur stated his intention to retain the Brigade in
Japan, unless a more critical situation developed in Korea prior to 10
September. He described his operation planned for mid-September as an
amphibious landing in the rear of the enemy’s lines. This seaborne
attack, he added, would be designed to envelop and destroy the Communist
invader in conjunction with an offensive from the south by the
Eighth Army. The General concluded his message on notes of conditional
optimism and grave warning:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Although exact date of D-day is partially dependent upon enemy reaction during
month of August, I am convinced that an early and strong effort behind his front
will sever his main lines of communications and enable us to deliver a decisive and
crushing blow. Any material delay in such an operation may lose this opportunity.
The alternative is a frontal attack which can only result in a protracted and expensive
campaign to slowly drive the enemy north of the 38th parallel.”<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_88" href="#FNanchor_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> CINCFE msg C-58473 to JCS, 23 Jul 50.</p></div>

<p>On 25 July these exchanges came to a climax when the Pentagon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
directed the Marine Corps to build its 1st Division to full war strength.</p>

<p>At this point the change of heart among the joint Chiefs of Staff is
pertinent because of its direct effects on the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade.
As previously noted, the Pentagon on 22 July approved the Marine
Corps’ plan Able which provided for the expansion of the Brigade to
war strength. General Cates immediately set machinery in motion to
bolster the ranks of that unit. With the approval of Admiral Sherman,
he cut into the rosters of Marine security detachments throughout the
United States and arranged for the personnel thus released to be channelled
to Craig’s command. It was also possible now to implement an
earlier plan relating to casualty replacements for the Brigade. As far back
as 14 July, the Commandant had ordered activation of the First Replacement
Draft, fixing its departure for Korea at 10 August.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> Thus Craig
could be assured of early reinforcement by more than 800 officers and
men if the course of the war necessitated a premature commitment of his
Brigade.</p>

<h3><i>The Advance Party in Japan</i></h3>

<p>Generals Craig and Cushman were meanwhile assigned a large office in
General Headquarters, Tokyo. There they cleared away much administrative
detail which accumulates in the path of every military operation.</p>

<p>On 20 July the two commanders called on General Stratemeyer.
Marine Air was the focal point of discussion as they again explained the
organization of their fighting team. When they informed Stratemeyer of
MacArthur’s decision to keep the Brigade intact, the air officer gave them
further assurance that MAG-33 would always be available to support
the Marine ground force.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_90" href="#FNanchor_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> Craig, 25 Jan 54.</p></div>

<p>Originally, the Army planned to base the Marine ground elements at
Sasebo, Japan, and the air group 400 miles away at Itami Field, near
Kobe. Craig and Cushman realized that the resulting large gap would
give rise to problems in liaison, training, and supply. Hoping to change
such an undesirable arrangement, the Brigade staff carefully studied the
layout of available land and facilities. Armed with the results of this
research, Craig proposed to General Headquarters that all Marines be
based in the Kobe-Osaka-Kyoto area. After he outlined the advantages
of keeping the Brigade and its supporting aviation close together,<span class="pagenum"><a class="hidep" id="Page_61">61</a><a id="Page_62">62</a></span>
Wright responded encouragingly to the recommendation.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_91" href="#FNanchor_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<div id="ip_61" class="figcenter land">
  <img src="images/i_061.jpg" width="2081" height="1364" alt="(Japan and Korea)" />
  </div>

<p>Confident that the suggestion would be favorably considered, the
advance party flew to Itami on 21 July and made a detailed reconnaissance
of debarkation, billeting, and training sites. While Craig inspected
the area and prepared a report, Cushman examined the air base facilities
and established his headquarters according to the initial plan. The Marine
officers then returned to Tokyo 2 days later to push the request for
getting both air and ground forces located in the same area. To support
his proposal, Craig submitted a complete “floor plan” not only for the
Brigade but also for the entire 1st Marine Division. MacArthur’s staff
promptly approved.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_92" href="#FNanchor_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> <i>Ibid.</i>; LtGen E. A. Craig ltr to authors, 15 Apr 54 (Craig, 15 Apr 54); Weir, 16 Apr
54; and Brig SAR, <i>loc. cit.</i></p></div>

<p>On the 25th the advance party again set out for Itami, this time to
prepare for the arrival of the Brigade. Their plane was a scant 20 minutes
out of Tokyo when an urgent message from General Headquarters
directed their return to that city at once. The big aircraft roared back to
the field, and a few minutes later the Marines were driving through the
Japanese capital.</p>

<p>At headquarters, Wright summed up the most recent reports from the
front. The American forward wall was crumbling under continuous
hammering. A wide envelopment had just netted the whole southwestern
tip of the peninsula for the Communists, who were now pressing
in on Pusan from the west as well as north. Lacking sufficient troops
to defend its broad frontage, the Eighth Army was falling back. If the
Red tide continued unabated, there was imminent danger of losing
Pusan, the one remaining major port in American hands. Should this
coastal city fall, South Korea would be lost.</p>

<p>Wright told Craig that all available troops had to be thrown into the
line to meet this threat. Therefore, General MacArthur had diverted the
seaborne Brigade from Japan to Korea, where it would join General
Walker’s beleaguered forces.<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>Obviously, the Marines were not far from a fight.</p>

<h3><i>Voyage of the Brigade</i></h3>

<p>At sea the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade was unaware of the decisions
and difficulties developing on higher levels. Nevertheless, that tactical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
organization was having enough trouble of its own. On 12 July, Company
A, 1st Tank Battalion, and the 1st Amphibious Tractor Company
departed San Diego on board the LSD’s <i>Fort Marion</i> and <i>Gunston Hall</i>.
Designated Task Unit 53.7.3, the twin amphibious ships sailed 2 days
before the rest of the Brigade and were scheduled to join the main convoy,
Task Group 53.7, before crossing 160° east longitude.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_94" href="#FNanchor_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> Brig SAR, <i>loc. cit.</i></p></div>

<p>At noon on 13 July, the well deck of the <i>Fort Marion</i> accidentally
flooded, the water rising to a height of 5 feet among the Brigade’s M-26
tanks. An hour passed before the ship’s pumps could drain the compartment,
and briny water damaged 14 of the new armored vehicles, 300
90-mm. projectiles (then in critical supply), and 5,000 rounds of
.30-caliber ammunition.</p>

<p>When news of the flood damage reached Brigade headquarters, then
still at San Diego, the message was rushed to Craig. He immediately
sent a dispatch to Captain English, authorizing him to jettison the
ruined ammunition. He added that replacement armor would be requisitioned
from the Barstow depot without delay. Craig then contacted the
supply base and was promised that 14 M-26’s would be commissioned
and on their way to San Diego within 24 hours. The Brigade commander
was preparing to request additional shipping for the vehicles
when messages from the <i>Fort Marion</i> reported that 12 tanks could be
restored to operating condition at sea. The remaining two would require
new parts and 72 hours of repair work upon debarkation.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_95" href="#FNanchor_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> <i>Ibid.</i>; and Craig, 15 Apr 54.</p></div>

<p>As already noted, the Marines were placing heavy reliance on their
armor, confident that it was a match for the enemy’s Russian-built T-34
tank in Korea. Consequently, Craig’s staff reacted to the flood reports
with concern. Headquarters FMFPac was asked to include four M-26’s
in its first resupply shipment to the Brigade; arrangements were made
for new parts to be flown to the port of debarkation, and ammunition to
replace that damaged in the flood was loaded on board the larger convoy.</p>

<p>Misfortune struck again a few hours after Task Group 53.7 steamed
from San Diego on 14 July. The transport <i>Henrico</i> developed a serious
mechanical failure and was declared temporarily unseaworthy. This ship
was carrying Lieutenant Colonel Murray, his regimental staff, and the
entire 1st Battalion Landing Team.<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> After Murray and his headquarters
transferred to the APA <i>Pickaway</i> off San Clemente island, the <i>Henrico</i>
limped back toward California with about one-third of the Brigade’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
fighting force. The vessel docked at the United States Naval Supply
Depot, Oakland, on the 16th. Repairs were started in urgent haste, since
there was no other ship available. For security reasons, the Marines were
forbidden to leave ship except for training on the dock. On the nights of
the 16th and 17th, they sat on deck and gazed longingly at the beckoning
lights of San Francisco. Twice during this time the <i>Henrico</i> weighed
anchor and passed westward under the Golden Gate bridge; twice it was
forced to return for additional repairs. Finally, on the evening of the
18th, the vessel steamed under the great bridge for its third attempt.
This time it kept going, but it would not overtake the convoy until the
morning of the very day the ships reached their destination.</p>

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_96" href="#FNanchor_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> 1st Bn, 5th Marines, with supporting units.</p></div>

<p>During the voyage, strict wartime security measures, including radio
silence, were enforced on all ships. While the North Koreans were
believed to have no warships left afloat, their naval capabilities remained
hidden from the outside world by a blur of question marks. No one
realized more than the commander of Task Group 53.7<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> that it was
much too early to take Soviet Russia for granted.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>The <i>Henrico</i>, now travelling independently, had a spine-chilling
experience during her second night out of Oakland. The ship’s radar
picked up two “unidentified submarines” which appeared to be converging
on the stern of the lone vessel. General Quarters was sounded. While
sailors peered into the darkness from their battle stations, several hundred
Marines joked weakly in the troop compartments below the waterline.
After an anxious hour, the persistent spots on the electronic screen
vanished.</p>

<p>Shipboard life for the Brigade was otherwise uneventful. The troops
took part in physical drills as vigorously as the limited confines of vessels
would allow. Daily classes and conferences emphasized those subjects
most relevant to the news reports trickling back from the front. Success
of North Korean armor stimulated keen interest in land mines and the
new rocket launchers. Press commentaries on the battleground’s primitive
environment made even field sanitation a serious matter. Since there
was no military intelligence available on the North Korean forces, officers
and NCO’s turned to publications on Russian tactics and weapons.</p>

<p>As previously noted, Sasebo, Japan, was the original destination of the
ships transporting the Brigade’s ground elements. The <i>Achernar</i>, <i>Anderson</i>,
and <i>Badoeng Strait</i> were bound for Kobe with MAG-33. When
Craig’s proposal for consolidation was approved by General Headquarters,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
the entire convoy was ordered to Kobe. Then, on 25 July, Colonel
Edward W. Snedeker, Chief of Staff, received the dispatch sending the
ground force directly to Pusan.</p>

<p>This announcement came as no surprise to the majority of officers and
men. Day by day, news reports had been outlining the course of the war.
The shrinking perimeter of Walker’s army was traced on maps and
sketches throughout every ship. After the Communist “end run” in
southwest Korea, Marines began to wonder if there would be any front
at all by the time they arrived. In the captain’s mess of the <i>Pickaway</i>,
senior Marine and naval officers were giving odds that the Brigade would
reach the South Korean port only in time to cover a general evacuation
of the peninsula.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a></p>

<h3><i>The Advance Party in Korea</i></h3>

<p>With the Brigade well beyond the halfway point in its Pacific voyage,
Craig and his staff could not afford to waste a minute. At 1700 on 25
July they left Tokyo by plane for Korea. En route they landed at Itami,
where the Brigade commander and Cushman made hurried adjustments
to meet the new situation.<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn2"><a id="Footnote_99" href="#FNanchor_99" class="fnanchor">99</a> Craig, 25 Jan 54.</p></div>

<p>Leaving Itami on the 26th, they flew to Fukuoka, Japan. There they
transferred from their 4-engine Marine aircraft to a smaller Air Force
plane which could be accommodated on the primitive landing fields of
Korea. On the last lap of their journey, they reached Taegu at 1400.</p>

<p>Taegu was a dismal place during this crucial phase of the UN delaying
action. Hastily chosen as a headquarters by General Walker, the
ancient town gave the appearance of a remote outpost. Its airstrip was
crude. The fewness of the airmen and soldiers among the handful of
transport and fighter planes served only to emphasize the critical situation
of the UN forces.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_100" href="#FNanchor_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> Stewart, 15 Jan 54.</p></div>

<p>General Craig reported to General Walker immediately, while the
Brigade G-3, Lieutenant Colonel Joseph L. Stewart, met with his Eighth
Army opposite, Colonel William E. Bartlett. Later, Walker’s chief of
staff, Colonel Eugene M. Landrum, assembled all the Marine officers for
an official briefing. He explained that the Brigade had not been earmarked
for any specific mission. The battle situation was too fluid for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
firm plans. Information from the field was sketchy and unreliable, as
outnumbered Army forces slowly retreated. From the time of first contact
by American units, the front had been more of a blur than a distinct
line. Landrum concluded by saying that the Brigade must be prepared to
move anywhere after debarkation—and on a moment’s notice.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_101" href="#FNanchor_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>After he and his officers had been assigned rooms in a temporary barracks,
Craig requested permission to reconnoiter the combat zone.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a>
Walker assented, providing his own plane and pilot for the trip. Accompanied
by Stewart and Lieutenant Colonel Arthur A. Chidester, his G-4,
Craig flew first to Pusan, where he checked harbor facilities, roads, and
railways. There he conferred with Brigadier General Crump Garvin,
USA, to initiate preparations for the Brigade’s arrival.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_102" href="#FNanchor_102" class="fnanchor">102</a> The <em>combat zone</em> comprises that part of the theater of operations required for the conduct
of war by field forces. In this case it included all of Korea remaining in UN hands.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_103" href="#FNanchor_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> Craig, 25 Jan 54.</p></div>

<p>Leaving Pusan, the Marine officers flew over Chinhae, which they discovered
to be a suitable base, if necessary, for VMO-6 and the Brigade’s
air support control unit. Cruising westward, they passed over Masan,
then continued toward Chinju. From the latter vicinity, the enemy’s
envelopment was then threatening the western approaches to Pusan.
Veering northward, the reconnaissance party paralleled the Naktong
River. The pilot, who was familiar with the ground, briefed his passengers
along the way. By the time the plane returned to Taegu, the Marines
had a broad picture of the critical areas most likely to become
Brigade battlefields.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_104" href="#FNanchor_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>General Craig and his ground officers remained at Taegu 4 days. Attending
daily briefings of the Eighth Army staff, they acquired a sound
knowledge of the tactical situation. At a conference with Major General
Earle E. Partridge and his Fifth Air Force staff,<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> the Marines were
brought up to date on the disposition of aviation and its policy for
supporting UN ground forces.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_105" href="#FNanchor_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> Hq 5th AF was also located at Taegu.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_106" href="#FNanchor_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> Craig, 15 Apr 54.</p></div>

<p>In the fight for time, ground force units in line were frequently withdrawn
and shuttled to plug gaps in the sagging front. Reports from the
battlefield more often were food for the imagination rather than fact for
the planning room. All of this created confusion among Eighth Army
staff officers.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span></p>

<p>In the Taejon area the 24th Infantry Division had lost 770 officers and
men during the single week of 15–22 July. Of these casualties, 61 were
known dead, 203 wounded, and 506 missing in action.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> Among the
missing was General Dean, and the wounded included a regimental
commanding officer, a regimental executive officer, and a battalion
commander.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a></p>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_109" href="#FNanchor_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>Following this ordeal, the 24th had been relieved by the recently
arrived 1st Cavalry Division, which went into line alongside the 25th
Division in the Kumchon area. ROK divisions held to the north
and east, where NKPA forces were driving toward Pohang-dong.</p>

<p>The shape of strategic things to come was indicated late in July when
two NKPA divisions completed a much publicized “end run” past the
open UN left flank to the southwest tip of the peninsula, then wheeled
eastward for a drive on Pusan.</p>

<p>General Walker reacted promptly to the danger by recalling the 24th
Division from Eighth Army reserve and moving it southward from
Kumchon to block the enemy near Hadong. With the recently landed
29th Infantry attached, the division totalled only 13,351 officers and
men.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> Its front extended from the southern coast near Hadong to the
town of Kochang, 40 miles north.<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> In addition to manning this mountainous
line, the 24th had troops in action at Pohang-dong, more than
100 miles away on the east coast. There some of its units fought as Task
Force Perry, under direct control of Eighth Army headquarters.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_110" href="#FNanchor_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> <i>Ibid.</i>, No. 3, 29 Jul 50. Actually, as the report itself states, this figure is a meaningless
statistic, and exceeds the <em>real</em> total by several hundred. It was the practice not to subtract
missing-in-action casualties until 30 days after losses were reported. Also, casualty
reports from far-flung subordinate units were received irregularly, and some of these
undoubtedly were not available when this tally was made.</p></div>

<p>The 24th Division and 29th Infantry had no more than deployed
when they found themselves plunged into a confused 5-day fight.
Although they sold ground as dearly as possible, the Army units were
compelled to give up Hadong and fall back toward Chinju.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a></p>

<p>As the threat to Pusan grew more serious, the Eighth Army commander
shifted units. In order to protect the approaches from Chinju to
Pusan, he pulled the 25th Infantry Division back across the river Naktong
near Waegwan and moved it from the northern to the southern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
front in 48 hours. The next day saw the 1st Cavalry withdrawing across
the Naktong in the Waegwan area and blowing the bridges.</p>

<p>After being relieved in the south by the 25th Division, the 24th joined
the 1st Cavalry withdrawal to hastily organized defensive positions east
of the Naktong. ROK divisions continued to defend the northeast
approaches, while the 25th Division stood guard to block any enemy
move toward Chinju.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a></p>

<p>At this juncture General Craig became increasingly concerned about
prospects of maintaining the Brigade’s integrity as a Marine air-ground
team. He and his staff were aware that elements of the 29th Infantry had
been rushed from their ships directly into combat in the Chinju area,
and some units were badly mauled. Craig took occasion, therefore, to
remind Army leaders once more of the Marine tactical concept of the
indivisible air-ground team.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_115" href="#FNanchor_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> Stewart, 15 Jan 54.</p></div>

<p>MAG-33, said Craig, would have to unload its planes and prepare
them for action; and the control squadron would need an interval to set
up co-ordinated tactical air support.<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_116" href="#FNanchor_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> <i>Ibid.</i>; and Craig, 15 Apr 54.</p></div>

<h3><i>Crisis of Eighth Army</i></h3>

<p>As July drew to an end, the situation both on the northern and southwestern
fronts was developing into a crisis. Hourly it grew apparent that
the Eighth Army’s perimeter would have to shrink even more, so that
defenses could assume some depth in sensitive areas. Landrum indicated
for the first time that the Brigade was being considered primarily for a
mission on the left flank.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> Guided by this possibility, Craig and his staff
officers devoted a day to drawing up a flexible operation plan. The purpose
of this directive was to advise the Brigade’s subordinate commanders
of possible commitment in the Chinju, Kochang, or Kumchon
areas, in that order of probability. Also included were detailed instructions
for movement to forward assembly areas, broad missions for supporting
units, security measures to be taken, and a general outline of the
situation ashore.<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
The advance party extracted from the plan a fragmentary warning
order suitable for radio transmission. This message was delivered to
Eighth Army headquarters with a request that it be sent immediately to
the Brigade at sea.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a> Now Craig assumed that Snedeker and Murray

<p>At an Army briefing on the 29th, the Marines learned that the UN
left flank was collapsing. An air of uneasiness pervaded Taegu, and
Eighth Army headquarters began preparations for displacement to
Pusan. Craig was told that the Brigade definitely would be committed
in the southwest, unless a more critical situation suddenly sprang up
elsewhere. Again the Army officers added that the Marine unit actually
must be prepared to move in any direction on short notice.<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a></p>

<p>With the approval of the Eighth Army, the Brigade commander
immediately sent a message to COMNAVFE requesting that the Marine
air group be made available to support the ground force by 2
August, and that VMO-6 be transported to Korea as quickly as possible.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a>
Time was drawing short.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_122" href="#FNanchor_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>On 30 July, General Craig had a final conference with Generals
Walker and Partridge. This time, Walker himself told the Marine leader
that the Brigade would be sent to the southwest; and that the unit, once
committed, would be free to push forward without interference from
Eighth Army.<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> Partridge interjected that his planes would be available
to support Craig’s ground troops if Marine air did not arrive in time.<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a></p>

<p>Immediately after the conference, the Marine officers set out for Pusan
by jeep. While their vehicles bounced southward on the ancient road,
army headquarters in Taegu was sinking to new depths of dejection.
Chinju had just fallen, and the Red column was pounding on toward
Masan.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a></p>

Force—Bedlam on Pusan Water Front—The Brigade at Changwon—The
Pusan Perimeter—Brigade Air Strikes First—Planning
the Sachon-Chinju Offensive</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap al"><span class="smcap1">After the advance</span> party reached Pusan, General Craig established a
temporary command post in the headquarters building of General
Garvin’s Base Command. Then the Marine officers plunged into the final
phase of planning and preparation for the Brigade, although they were
still handicapped by the undisclosed secret of the convoy’s arrival date.
Staff gears were meshing smoothly by this time, with solutions being
ground out for one problem after another.</p>

<p>On the night of 30 July, Lieutenant Colonel Stewart and other staff
officers were discussing whether MAG-33 would be able to get its planes
airborne in time to support the Brigade in its initial combat. Acting on
a hunch, Stewart picked up a telephone in the slim hope of placing a call
through to Japan. The long shot paid off. After some wrangling by
startled operators, he managed to contact Itami Air Force Base and talk
to Colonel Kenneth H. Weir, Cushman’s chief of staff.</p>

<p>Stewart briefed the Marine aviator on the latest developments, emphasizing
that the Brigade would undoubtedly get into the fight soon after
arrival. He asked Weir to send the Air Support Section and helicopters
to Korea by LST as quickly as possible after unloading in Japan.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_126" href="#FNanchor_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> Stewart, 15 Jan 54.</p></div>

<p>Craig received a radio message that same night from FMFPac, informing
him that the replacements for the Brigade would not be sent directly
to Pusan, as requested. They were to be assembled at Camp Pendleton
for travel with the 1st Marine Division, and this meant a delay which
could be critical. Craig immediately insisted that the reinforcements be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
sent to Pusan to replace Brigade battle losses and form the third rifle
companies.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> The Marine leader’s determination in this instance proved
to be a blessing a few weeks later.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_127" href="#FNanchor_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> Craig, 25 Jan 54.</p></div>

<h3><i>Reconnaissance by Jeep</i></h3>

<p>On the morning of 31 July, Craig and Stewart set out by jeep to reconnoiter
the rear areas of the crumbling southwestern sector. Kean’s 25th
Division, having just replaced the 24th in line, was now blocking the
threatened western approaches to Pusan. Since all indications pointed to
the Brigade’s commitment in this area, Craig wanted to walk and ride
over the terrain he had previously scouted from the air.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_128" href="#FNanchor_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>He returned to Pusan just in time to receive a telephone call from
Colonel Landrum of Eighth Army Headquarters. The chief of staff told
him of General Walker’s intention to attach the Army’s 5th Regimental
Combat Team, newly arrived from Hawaii, to the 1st Provisional Marine
Brigade. With two regiments under his command, Craig would be
assigned a vital area of responsibility along the Nam River, near its confluence
with the Naktong north of Masan.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> Unfortunately, the Brigade
reached Korea 1 day too late. When the 5th RCT debarked at Pusan on
1 August, it was earmarked for the 25th Division and placed in Eighth
Army reserve.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a></p>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_130" href="#FNanchor_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> MCBS, II-A-7.</p></div>

<p>Also debarking on the 1st was the Army’s skeletonized 2d Division.
This unit cleared Pusan and hurried to the hard-pressed Taegu area where
it also passed into Eighth Army reserve.<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a></p>

<p>During the last hours before the Brigade’s arrival, Lieutenant Colonel
Chidester was diligently engaged in the task—or art—of procurement.
It has already been explained why the Marine ground force would debark
for combat with little more than what its troops could carry on
their backs. In order to offset partially the deficiencies, the G-4 successfully
negotiated with Army authorities for 50 cargo trucks, several jeeps,
some radio vans, and various other items of equipment. Officers of the
Pusan Base Command reacted to all of Chidester’s requests with as much
generosity as their meager stocks of materiel would allow.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_132" href="#FNanchor_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> Craig, 25 Jan 54.</p></div>

<p>Not until the morning of 2 August did General Craig learn that Task
Group 53.7 was scheduled to dock at Pusan that very evening. The last-minute
disclosure relieved him of considerable anxiety, but he was still
disturbed for want of specific orders concerning departure of the Brigade
from Pusan. His instructions from General Walker were to debark the
ground force immediately and have it prepared to move forward by 0600
the following morning. The same orders advised him that a specific
destination “would be given later.”<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_133" href="#FNanchor_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>“Later” did not come soon enough for the Marine commander. As the
long column of ships steamed into Pusan Harbor in the early evening,
he still did not know where he would lead his Brigade the next morning.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_134" href="#FNanchor_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<h3><i>Brigade Air Lands</i></h3>

<p>When Task Group 53.7 entered Far Eastern waters, the ships transporting
the forward echelon of the 1st Marine Aircraft Wing veered toward
Japan, while the others continued to Korea. The Brigade’s air arm
arrived at Kobe late in the afternoon of 31 July.</p>

<p>Within three hours debarkation had been completed and unloading
was in full swing. A waiting LST took on Marine Tactical Air Control
Squadron Two and the ground personnel and equipment of VMO-6. By
the next morning it was steaming toward Pusan, carrying the vital link
in General Craig’s air-ground team. Cushman and Weir were making
good their promises.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_135" href="#FNanchor_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> Annexes Charlie and Fox to MAG-33 SAR, 5 Jul-6 Sep 50.</p></div>

<p>Since harbor facilities at Kobe were unsuitable for offloading aircraft,
the <i>Badoeng Strait</i> stood out to sea on 1 August and catapulted 44 of its
Marine fighter planes into the air. The aircraft sped to the field at Itami,
where they were quickly checked by pilots and crews for their imminent
role in combat. On the following day, the other 26 fighters left the carrier
and joined the first group ashore for maintenance and testing.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_136" href="#FNanchor_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> Annex Charlie, <i>ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>To achieve maximum mobility and striking power, Marine and Navy
commanders agreed to base VMF’s 214 and 323 aboard aircraft carriers
for initial operations over Korea. After only 1 day of refresher flights at
Itami, the pilots of VMF-214 landed their planes aboard the U. S. S.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
<i>Sicily</i>. Two days later, on 5 August, Major Arnold Lund led his VMF-323
back to the <i>Badoeng Strait</i>.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a></p>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_137" href="#FNanchor_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> VMF-323 SAR, 3 Aug-6 Sep 50.</p></div>

<p>The squadron of night fighters, VMF(N)-513, was land-based. Having
been assigned to the Fifth Air Force, it would be controlled by the
Itazuke field for night heckler missions over Korea. This unit had time
for only a few night training flights before being committed to combat.<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_138" href="#FNanchor_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> Annex Charlie, <i>op. cit.</i></p></div>

<p>Kobe’s waterfront was the scene of feverish activity around the clock.
The light observation planes and helicopters of VMO-6 were unloaded,
assembled, and—to the amazement of local Japanese—flown from the
very streets of the city to the base at Itami. There they were hurriedly
checked by mechanics and prepared for the short ferry flight to Korea.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_139" href="#FNanchor_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>Headquarters and Service Squadrons of MAG-33 were left with the
task of unloading supplies and equipment from the <i>Achernar</i> and <i>Anderson</i>.
Since the three fighter squadrons were farmed out to the carriers
and Air Force, Group headquarters turned its attention to administrative
and maintenance matters. For the next month it would be hard-pressed
to keep the carrier squadrons supplied with spare parts while providing
replacement aircraft for the seaborne units, handling a variety of airlift
requests with its lone transport plane, and making arrangements for the
support of VMF(N)-513 at Itazuke.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<h3><i>Landing of Ground Force</i></h3>

<p>The hapless <i>Henrico</i> finally overtook Task Group 53.7 in the Tsushima
Straits on the morning of 2 August. A few hours later the Marines of the
Brigade got their first glimpse of Korea’s skyline. Seen from a distance,
the wall of forbidding, gray peaks was hardly a welcome sight to men
who had been broiled and toughened on the heights of Camp Pendleton.</p>

<p>For reasons unknown, neither Colonel Snedeker nor anyone else had
received the operations plan which Craig had sent via Eighth Army at
Taegu. Although every Marine in the convoy realized the gravity of the
situation ashore, there could be no specific preparations by troop leaders
whose only source of information was an occasional news broadcast.</p>

<p>Having heard nothing from his superiors, Lieutenant Colonel Murray
was thinking in terms of a purely administrative landing. Had he known<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
what awaited his 5th Marines ashore, he would have had his troops
draw ammunition and rations while still at sea. Throughout the sleepless
night that followed, he had ample time to reflect sourly on the fortunes
of war.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_141" href="#FNanchor_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> Murray, 15 Feb 54.</p></div>

<p>Shortly after 1700 on 2 August, the first ship steamed into Pusan Harbor.
As it edged toward the dock, Leathernecks crowding the rail were
greeted by a tinny and slightly tone-deaf rendition of the Marine Corps
Hymn, blared by a South Korean band. Army troops scattered along the
waterfront exchanged the usual barbed courtesies with their webfooted
brethren aboard ship, and old salts smiled while noting that tradition remained
intact.</p>

<p>When the <i>Clymer</i> approached its berth, Craig waved a greeting to
Snedeker and shouted, “What battalion is the advance guard?”<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_142" href="#FNanchor_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> BrigGen E. W. Snedeker ltr to CMC, 21 Apr 54.</p></div>

<p>The chief of staff registered an expression of astonishment.</p>

<p>“Did you get my orders?” Craig called to Murray when the <i>Pickaway</i>
slid against the dock.</p>

<p>“No, sir!”<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> replied the CO of the 5th Marines.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_143" href="#FNanchor_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> Murray, 15 Feb 54.</p></div>

<p>Craig ordered a conference at 2100 for the Brigade staff, Murray, battalion
commanders, and the leaders of supporting units. When the officers
entered the wardroom of the <i>Clymer</i> at the specified time, the last
ship of Task Group 53.7 was being moored in its berth.</p>

<p>After introductory remarks by the general, his G-2, Lieutenant Colonel
Ellsworth G. Van Orman, launched the briefing with a grim narrative
of the enemy situation. Next came Stewart, who outlined tentative
operations plans. The Brigade would definitely begin moving forward
at 0600 the next morning, although a specific destination had yet to be
assigned by the Army. Travel would be by road and rail. The necessary
trains were already awaiting in the Pusan terminal, and the 50 trucks
procured by Chidester were standing by, complete with Army drivers.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_144" href="#FNanchor_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> Stewart, 15 Jan 54.</p></div>

<p>Craig then summed up his earlier discussions with Walker. The
Army leader had voiced a strong desire to use the Marines in an attack,
for he felt it was high time to strike back at the Red invader. Employment
of the Brigade as an offensive force was a natural conclusion to its
commander, and he told his subordinates how he had won assurances
for the integrity of the air-ground team. This was an encouraging note
on which to close one of the strangest combat briefings in the history<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
of the Corps. The leaders of over 4,000 Marines rushed from the ship to
alert their units for movement into a critical tactical situation. They
would leave in a few hours, but didn’t know where they were going.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_145" href="#FNanchor_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<h3><i>Bedlam on Pusan Waterfront</i></h3>

<p>It is not surprising that the Pusan waterfront turned into a bedlam. As
darkness settled, thousands of Marines poured onto the docks. Cranes
and working parties unloaded vehicles, supplies and equipment, while
a chorus of commands and comments was added to the roar of machinery.
Supply points were set up under searchlights, and long lines of
Marines formed on the docks, in buildings and along streets. Armfuls
of C-rations, machinegun belts, grenades, and bandoleers gave men the
appearance of harried Christmas shoppers caught in a last-minute rush.</p>

<p>The activity and din continued all night. Few men could sleep
through the noise, crowding, and shuffling. Before dawn, new lines
began to form in reverse as groggy Marines filed back aboard ships to
get their last hot meal for many a day.</p>

<p>After the conference aboard the <i>Clymer</i>, Brigade headquarters resumed
its efforts to obtain specific information from Taegu. Finally, at 2325,
Landrum telephoned Craig and announced Walker’s decision—the
Brigade would go westward to the vicinity of Changwon, where it
would remain for the time being in Eighth Army reserve. Only Walker
himself could order any further move. If some extreme emergency arose
and communications with Eighth Army were lost, the Brigade would
then come under the control of the CG, 25th Infantry Division.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_146" href="#FNanchor_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> Craig, 25 Jan 54.</p></div>

<p>The long-awaited message gave added impetus to the unloading operations.
Major William L. Batchelor’s shore party company devoted one
of its principal efforts to the big howitzers and vehicles of 1/11, while
English and his tankmen struggled to get their steel monsters ashore
from the LSD’s. Engineer heavy equipment, mobile maintenance shops
of the Ordnance Detachment, fuel, ammunition, and medical supplies
swung from decks to docks, where waiting Marines rushed them off to
staging areas around the waterfront.</p>

<p>Altogether, 9,400 tons of supplies were unloaded, and the vast majority
were turned over to Army quartermaster authorities in Pusan. Four
officers and 100 men of Major Thomas J. O’Mahoney’s Combat Service<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
Detachment were designated as the Brigade rear echelon. This group
would remain in the port city to handle logistical and administrative
matters. Supplies were moved into Army warehouses, where they became
part of the common pool shared by all units at the front. This led
to confusion later, when the Brigade requested its own Class II and IV
items, only to discover that they had already been issued to other outfits.
But the Army divisions had already been fighting for a month in a
war which caught the nation unprepared, so that the Pusan Base Command
had no alternative but to issue supplies on the basis of immediate
need, not ownership.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_147" href="#FNanchor_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> Brig SAR, basic rpt.</p></div>

<p>The Brigade was prepared to travel light. Not only the bulk of supplies
but also all personal baggage was left behind in Pusan, to be stored
and safeguarded by the rear echelon. When dawn broke on 3 August,
each Marine carried only his pack, weapon, ammunition, and rations.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_148" href="#FNanchor_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> Annex Queen, <i>ibid.</i></p></div>

<h3><i>The Brigade at Changwon</i></h3>

<p>Despite the tumult of the sleepless night at Pusan, Lieutenant Colonel
George R. Newton’s 1st Battalion set out for Changwon shortly after
0600 on 3 August. As advance guard for the Brigade, it made the 40-mile
trip in Marine and Army trucks, reaching a point 1 mile west of
the town at 1400. There the battalion took up defensive positions astride
the Changwon-Masan road in order to cover the arrival of the remainder
of the Brigade.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_149" href="#FNanchor_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> Annex How.</p></div>

<p>Although he had orders to bivouac at Changwon, General Craig decided
to deploy the Brigade defensively to the west of the town. This
decision was prompted by the enemy situation west of Masan, which
was a scant 6½ miles from Changwon. Then, too, the Marine commander
saw the layover as a final opportunity to check the field
discipline of the Brigade.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_150" href="#FNanchor_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> Craig, 25 Jan 54.</p></div>

<p>Between 0630 and 0700, the main body of the Marine ground force
moved out of Pusan by road and rail. Vehicles over 2½ tons, all heavy
equipment, and the M-26 tanks were transported on flatcars.</p>

<p>The roads were narrow and bumpy, and the churning wheels of the
trucks threw up clouds of stifling dust that hung in the air and painted
Marines and equipment a ghostly gray. Aboard the primitive trains,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
which frequently jolted to stops for no apparent reason, men tried vainly
to fit themselves to miniature wooden seats constructed in perfect right
angles. And always, the troops inhaled that characteristic odor drifting
in from well-fertilized rice paddies.</p>

<p>By 1600, all combat and support elements of the Brigade, with the
exception of one tank platoon, had arrived in the Changwon area.
Southwest of the city the 1st Battalion was relieved of its responsibility
on the left side of the Changwon-Masan road, when 3/5 occupied the
high ground in that area. Newton was then able to extend his right
flank farther along the towering ridge north of the road.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_151" href="#FNanchor_151" class="fnanchor">151</a> Annex How.</p></div>

<p>South of the MSR, a wide rice paddy stretched between 3/5’s positions
and the town. Almost in the center of this low ground was a hill
commanding a good all-around view of the entire area. It was on this
dominating height that Lieutenant Colonel Harold S. Roise deployed
his 2d Battalion. Behind Roise, General Craig established his CP in a
small basin among hills in the immediate vicinity of Changwon. Close-in
protection for his headquarters was provided by the engineer company
and various headquarters units. Throughout the interior of the
bivouac area were tank platoons and the batteries of Lieutenant Colonel
Wood’s artillery battalion.</p>

<p>As night settled on 3 August, an army of phantoms invaded the
Brigade perimeter and drove to the very fringe of Craig’s CP. The reaction
of green troops was typical of men new to combat. Shortly after
2200, a rifle shot cracked. Many Brigade Marines had never heard a weapon
fired in combat, so they concluded that likely targets were present
in the perimeter area. As nerve-taut men stared fixedly into the blackness,
forms that had been harmless bushes and rocks took on the guise
of Communist infiltrators.</p>

<p>The first shot was soon followed by others. Toward midnight, the firing
developed into a continuous crackle, particularly in the immediate
vicinity of the Brigade CP. Palpitating hearts pounded even more
strenuously when two Marine machineguns began chattering in positions
occupied by Brigade headquarters troops.</p>

<p>Anxiety also spread to the foxholes of the 5th Marines. In 2/5’s area
one man was shot. The 1st Battalion suffered 2 casualties, 1 resulting
from mistaken identity during challenging, the other inflicted when a
weapon discharged accidentally.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_152" href="#FNanchor_152" class="fnanchor">152</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>The commotion finally died down around 0300, after cursing NCO’s
convinced the military novices that they had been firing at delusions of
their own overwrought imaginations.</p>

<p>Although such a reaction is not uncommon among untried troops,
this realization was no balm to a wrathful Brigade commander at dawn
on 4 August. Craig called in leaders of the most obvious offenders and
severely reprimanded them. He made it known in no uncertain terms
that such conduct would not be tolerated again; and from that time on,
every man in the Brigade took him at his word.</p>

<p>The remainder of the stay at Changwon was relatively calm. On one
occasion a group of seven unidentified persons was spotted atop a
mountain overlooking the Brigade area. Closer scrutiny disclosed that
the individuals had radios and were carefully observing all activity within
the Marine perimeter. A platoon of infantry was dispatched to destroy
what was apparently an enemy observation post; but by the time the
rifleman scaled the height, both intruders and radios had disappeared.</p>

<p>The climb caused a number of heat prostration cases within the platoon,
for Korean terrain and heat were giving Marines their first bitter
taste of a crippling combination. Brigade helicopters, flown to Pusan on
2 August, set a combat precedent by delivering rations and water to the
infantrymen on the mountain, and by evacuating the more severe heat
casualties.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_153" href="#FNanchor_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> Brig SAR, basic rpt.</p></div>

<p>While Craig’s ground force spent its time patrolling and training
around Changwon, VMO-6 and the Air Support Section (MTACS-2)
were readying themselves. Accompanying the 4 HO3S helicopters in
the flight to Pusan from Japan on 2 August were 4 of VMO-6’s OY-2
observation planes. The other 4 light aircraft remained in Japan, to be
used as spares. On 4 August the LST which had been dispatched by
Cushman and Weir also arrived at the South Korean port. While two
helicopters flew to Changwon to operate from Craig’s CP, the others,
together with the rest of VMO-6 and the Air Support Section, moved to
the airfield at Chinhae. By 5 August, MTACS-2 had established communications
with the <i>Sicily</i> and <i>Badoeng Strait</i> and was ready for business.</p>

<h3><i>The Pusan Perimeter</i></h3>

<p>The big picture, militarily speaking, was outlined in somber colors
during the first few days of August 1950. Only the southeast corner of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
Korea was left to the Eighth Army and its battered ROK allies. Space
had been traded for time until there remained in effect merely a UN
beachhead about 90 miles long and 60 wide.</p>

<p>Unremitting enemy pressure throughout July had pushed the UN
forces back to positions stretching raggedly from Pohang-dong on the
east coast to Masan on the south coast by way of Taegu in the center.
The logistical lifeline extended from Pusan to Taegu both by road and
rail, and some 300,000 tons of supplies were moved in July by the Pusan
Logistical Command.</p>

<p>The vital seaport had to be held if the UN forces were to retain a
foothold in the peninsula, and the enemy was already threatening both
Pohang-dong and Masan, each within 50 miles. Only by courtesy could
the irregular chain of UN positions have been called a line. Gaps were
the rule rather than exception, and an entire enemy corps might have
driven through the mountainous area between Andong and Yongdok
without meeting serious opposition. Nor was this the only spot where
the dangerously stretched UN forces had to depend on the terrain for
support. Yet the time had come to make a stand, and this final UN
beachhead has gone down in history by the name of the Pusan
Perimeter.</p>

<p>From Taegu in the center to the eastern coast, five depleted ROK divisions
were arrayed during the first week in August. East of the Naktong,
from the Taegu-Waegwan area southward, the 1st Cavalry and the 24th
Infantry Division held defensive positions. This left the southern sector
to the 25th Division, reinforced by the Army 5th RCT and the 1st Provisional
Marine Brigade.</p>

<p>The principal enemy units pressing toward Masan and Pusan in the
southern sector were identified as the NKPA 6th Infantry Division and
the 83d Motorcycle Regiment. Composed entirely of Chinese civil war
veterans in July 1949, the 6th Division had at that time been the 166th
Division, 56th CCF Army, which later entered Korea as a completely
equipped unit. Its three infantry regiments, the 13th, 14th, and 15th,
were distinguished throughout the invasion for a high esprit de corps.
After capturing Yongdungpo, an industrial suburb of Seoul, the 6th had
pushed southward and won fresh honors by forcing the river Kum and
taking Kunsan by storm.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_154" href="#FNanchor_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> FECOM, ATIS, <cite>North Korean 6th Infantry Division</cite> (InterRpt, Sup No. 100), 33–6.</p></div>

<p>On the eve of the Kunsan operation, according to a captured enemy
document, troops of the 6th were informed that they were facing a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
United States Army regiment. “Since this unit is planning to advance to
the north, it is our mission to envelop and annihilate it.... We are
fully prepared and confident of success in this operation.”<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_155" href="#FNanchor_155" class="fnanchor">155</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>A numerical superiority as well as good combat discipline enabled the
initial assault waves to cross the Kum in pneumatic floats and establish
a bridgehead before noon on 16 July 1950. Half of the town of Kunsan
was occupied before nightfall, and the United States and ROK defenders
withdrew under cover of darkness.</p>

<p>Next came the “end run,” with 6th Division units racing toward the
capture of Namwon, Kwangju, Yosu, and Mokpu in the southwest
corner of the peninsula. No opposition awaited except ineffectual delaying
actions by ROK constabulary troops. After mopping up a few small
pockets of resistance, the 6th Division pushed eastward to lead the
North Korean drive toward Pusan.</p>

<p>The capture of Sunchon gave the division an assembly area for the
attack on Chinju. And on 28 July the commander. Major General Pang,
issued a message to his troops:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Comrades, the enemy is demoralized. The task given to us is the liberation of
Masan and Chinju and the annihilation of the remnants of the enemy. We have
liberated Mokpu, Kwangju and Yosu and have thereby accelerated the liberation of
all Korea. However, the liberation of Chinju and Masan means the final battle to
cut off the windpipe of the enemy. Comrades, this glorious task has fallen to our
division! Men of the 6th Division, let us annihilate the enemy and distinguish
ourselves!”<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a></p></blockquote>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_156" href="#FNanchor_156" class="fnanchor">156</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>Up to that time the division’s total casualties had been remarkably
few. Only 400 killed and wounded were reported from 25 June until
after the capture of Kunsan, and the 6th had met scarcely any opposition
since that action. It was just prior to the assault on Chinju, moreover,
that the 83d Motorcycle Regiment was attached to reinforce the
drive toward Pusan.</p>

<p>This unit had been part of the 105th Armored Division until June
1950, when it was given a separate existence. Equipment consisted of
motorcycles with sidecars and jeeps of Soviet manufacture. Fixed machineguns
on both types of vehicles were operated by the crews in addition
to submachineguns. Not much is known about the numbers of
the 83d at this time, but it had experienced little combat since the beginning
of the invasion.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span></p>

<p>During the advance on Chinju the NKPA column ran into elements
of the United States 24th Infantry Division and was stopped by machinegun
fire at Hadong. All three regiments of the 6th Division had
to be committed before this halfway point could be secured, and the 83d
Motorcycle Regiment was blooded in the attack. More hard fighting
awaited on the road to Chinju, but the two NKPA outfits battled their
way into the town on or about 30 July 1950.</p>

<h3><i>Brigade Air Strikes First</i></h3>

<p>These North Korean units were destined to become the opponents of
the Brigade a few days later. Before the Marine ground forces could get
into action, however, the air components struck the first blow.</p>

<p>When Lieutenant Colonel Walter E. Lischeid’s VMF-214 landed on
board the <i>Sicily</i> on 3 August, eight of its Corsairs were immediately refueled
and armed. At 1630, the initial Marine offensive action of the war
was launched as the fighter planes roared up from the carrier’s flight deck.
Minutes later their incendiary bombs and rockets were hitting Red-held
Chinju and the village of Sinban-ni. A series of strafing runs concluded
the Marines’ greeting to the North Korean People’s Army.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_158" href="#FNanchor_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> VMF-214 SAR, 14 Jul-6 Sep 50.</p></div>

<p>While the 2 Red bases were erupting in smoke and flame, 2 other
pilots of the squadron flew from the <i>Sicily</i> to Taegu to be briefed on the
broad tactical situation. They returned from their visit with maps and
intelligence material for guidance in future operations.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_159" href="#FNanchor_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>The squadron flew 21 sorties on 4 August against enemy bases controlling
the pressure on Eighth Army’s southern flank. Racing in from
the sea, gull-winged Marine planes struck at bridges, railroads, and troop
concentrations in the Chinju and Sachon areas.</p>

<p>On 5 August, the <i>Sicily</i> steamed into the Yellow Sea. Marine planes
descended on Inchon, Seoul, and Mokpo, battering airfields, factories,
warehouses, railroads, bridges, and harbor facilities. The same pattern of
destruction was repeated the following day.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_160" href="#FNanchor_160" class="fnanchor">160</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>On 6 August came a thundering bid for fame by VMF-323, as its
sleek Corsairs streaked toward Korea. Operating from the deck of the
<i>Badoeng Strait</i>, the squadron flew 30 sorties in deep support forward of
Eighth Army lines. Carrying the mail with 500-pound bombs, 20-mm.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
cannon and 5-inch rockets, Marine pilots struck at Communist troop
concentrations, vehicles, supply dumps, bridges and railroads.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_161" href="#FNanchor_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> VMF-323 SAR, <i>op. cit.</i></p></div>

<h3><i>Planning the Sachon-Chinju Offensive</i></h3>

<p>As early as 3 August, during the Brigade move from Pusan to Changwon,
General Craig and Lieutenant Colonel Stewart had flown by helicopter
to Masan for a conference of troop commanders. There they
joined General Walker and General Kean at the latter’s 25th Division
command post. Also present was Brigadier General George B. Barth,
artillery officer of the 25th.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_162" href="#FNanchor_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> Craig, 25 Jan 54.</p></div>

<p>Craig suggested to the Eighth Army commander that some ROK
army trainees be attached to the Brigade. There were thousands of such
Korean recruits, and a few serving as scouts, interpreters, and rear-area
guards would be of great value to the Marines. Walker agreed to provide
the native troops and arm them as well.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_163" href="#FNanchor_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>The Army leader confirmed the previous night’s telephonic orders
which had caused the Brigade’s move to Changwon. After the four
generals had discussed the tactical situation on the southern flank,
Walker directed Craig to have the Brigade prepared for commitment to
combat any time after the evening of 5 August.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_164" href="#FNanchor_164" class="fnanchor">164</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>This schedule worked out perfectly from Craig’s point of view. The
Air Support Section at Chinhae had just established communications
with the two carrier-based squadrons. Army-Navy-Marine co-operation
thus enabled the Brigade commander to lead his entire air-ground team
into battle.</p>

<p>On 5 August Craig and Stewart flew to Masan for a final meeting with
Walker and Kean. The Eighth Army commander outlined his plans for
the first UN counteroffensive. In forceful terms, he expressed his dissatisfaction
with the course of the war up to that time. He announced
that the strategy of trading space for time had come to an end, and he
did not mince words in referring to past UN defeats. With firm conviction
in the cause, he had ordered all units to stand to the death. The
Eighth Army could not and would not lose more ground or equipment.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a>
Advances had been made by the enemy with such rapidity that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
he had extended his supply lines almost to the breaking point, concluded
Walker. The time had come to strike back.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_165" href="#FNanchor_165" class="fnanchor">165</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_166" href="#FNanchor_166" class="fnanchor">166</a> Stewart, 15 Jan 54.</p></div>

<p>To the 25th Division, 1st Provisional Marine Brigade, and 5th RCT
would go the honor of launching the counterattack from Chindong-ni, a
small coastal village 8 miles southwest of Masan on the road to Chinju.
In its effort to roll up the southern UN flank, the NKPA 6th Division
was exerting heavy pressure on Chindong-ni from both the west and
north.</p>

<p>A few miles west, the irregular coastline takes a sharp turn to the south
to form a stubby peninsula about 25 miles wide and 15 miles long. Near
the western base is the important town of Sachon. About 10 miles above
this western junction of peninsula and coast lies Chinju. Both Sachon
and Chinju were the targets of Walker’s counteroffensive.</p>

<p>Approximately 3½ miles west of Chindong-ni is the tiny thatched-hut
hamlet of Tosan, an unimpressive road junction which could be
easily overlooked. The western fork is merely the continuation of the
main route leading directly to Chinju, some 25 miles distant. The other
fork branches south from Tosan and also goes to Chinju; but it skirts the
coastline of the peninsula just described, passing through the communication
hubs of Paedun-ni, Kosong, and Sachon. Thus, while both
roads lead to Chinju, the southern or peninsular route is 17 miles longer.</p>

<p>Since it was known that enemy forces were present on the small
peninsula, any UN thrust astride the main road to Chinju would be
exposed to a constant flanking threat from the left. To eliminate this
danger. Walker had decided to send the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade
around the southern route from Tosan to Sachon. After the peninsula
was secured, the 5th RCT would strike out for Chinju along the main
road, while the 35th Infantry of the 25th Division guarded its right flank
in the mountains to the north.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_167" href="#FNanchor_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> Stewart, 15 Jan 54.</p></div>

<p>Craig and Stewart opposed this plan, arguing that the Brigade itself
would be exposed to flanking danger on the right, if it made the initial
advance alone.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_168" href="#FNanchor_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>After further discussion, it was decided that all three units would
attack simultaneously along the routes already designated. However, the
5th RCT was given a preparatory mission of uncovering the Tosan junction
before the Brigade began its advance.<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> D-day was scheduled for 7<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
August. All participating units were to be part of Task Force Kean, so
named after the 25th Division commanding general who would exercise
overall control.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_169" href="#FNanchor_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> Annex How; and Brig Op Plan 4-50.</p></div>

<p>Craig hurried from the conference to alert the Brigade. In a past military
age a general might have sprung into the saddle, but the Brigade
commander had discovered a steed that covered more ground. He and
Stewart climbed into a HO3S-1 helicopter piloted by Lieutenant Gustave
F. Lueddeke of VMO-6, and a few minutes later they landed at Lieutenant
Colonel Murray’s CP to brief him on the forthcoming action.</p>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">On 6 August 1950</span> the Brigade was attached to the 25th Infantry
Division and ordered forward to Chindong-ni. The area from that
village westward toward the Tosan junction was occupied by thinly
spread elements of the 5th RCT and the 27th Infantry. While the former
took over front line positions preparatory to launching the main attack
on the next day, the latter was gradually displacing rearward to go into
Eighth Army reserve.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a></p>

<p>To facilitate the early relief of the 27th Infantry, Lieutenant Colonel
Robert D. Taplett’s 3d Battalion, 5th Marines, departed from Changwon
at 1040, 6 August, and arrived at Chindong-ni less than 2 hours later.
The infantry unit was accompanied by the 1st Battalion, 11th Marines;
the 2d Platoon, 75-mm. Recoilless Guns; and the 3d Platoon, Company
A Engineers. After assembling in a schoolyard north of the village, 3/5
relieved the 2d Battalion, 27th Infantry, on and around Hill 255.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_171" href="#FNanchor_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> All hill numbers given in this text refer to the highest peak of the specific high ground
being considered. Numbers indicate height in meters above sea level, and Hill 255 is therefore
more than 800 feet high. Chindong-ni, being almost at the water’s edge, may be taken
as sea level.</p></div>

<p>One and a half miles out of Chindong-ni, the road from Masan takes
a sharp turn so that it is running generally north and south before it
enters the village. Hill 255 borders the west side of the road, rising from
the valley floor just above Chindong-ni and climbing northward to its
summit in a series of prominent steps. Its ridgeline is narrow, with the
eastern slopes falling steeply to the Masan route while its western wall<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
plunges sharply to the valley and road connecting Chindong-ni and
Haman.</p>

<p>Taplett set up his CP, headquarters units, and weapons company
along the first step of the hill. Higher up, at the top of the second rise,
Captain Joseph C. Fegan deployed Company H in defensive positions
facing generally north. Forward, a long narrow plateau stretched for 250
yards before the third step of the ridge rose abruptly to the second
highest peak on the hill. Noting the advantages of the commanding
ground to his north, Fegan requested permission to move his company
forward to that area. Since this would have placed him 500 yards from
the nearest 3/5 unit, the request could not be granted.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_172" href="#FNanchor_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> Maj Joseph C. Fegan interv with authors, 17 Apr 54 (Fegan, 17 Apr 54).</p></div>

<p>The battalion commander intended to keep his defenses as tightly knit
as possible in order to discharge his mission of blocking the approaches
to the Masan-Chindong-ni MSR. Despite vigorous patrolling by 25th
Division units in the mountains between the coastal village and Haman,
intelligence reported increasing numbers of enemy troops, heavy
weapons, and equipment in the area to the north. It appeared that large
NKPA forces were slipping through and descending on Chindong-ni to
“cut off the windpipe” of Walker’s southern flank.</p>

<p>First Lieutenant Robert D. Bohn, commander of Company G, deployed
his 2d and 3d Platoons on Hill 99, to the west and across the
valley from 255. He arranged his defenses to block the approaches from
the high ground on his north (actually an extension of Hill 99) and
from the valley to the west, separating him from massive Hill 342.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a></p>

<p>On a small knoll at the base of Hill 255 was deployed Company G’s
1st Platoon, commanded by Second Lieutenant John H. Cahill. With
the 75-mm. recoilless gun platoon attached, this unit guarded the
Haman road 600 yards from Chindong-ni.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a></p>

<p>On high ground east of the MSR and beyond the village sat the 2d
Platoon of Company H, with the mission of defending against infiltration
from the direction of the sea and the mountains southeast of the
road to Masan.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a></p>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_175" href="#FNanchor_175" class="fnanchor">175</a> Fegan, 17 Apr 54.</p></div>

<p>This completed the infantry deployment. Company H had its three
platoons spread over 1,500 yards, while those of Company G ranged at
least an equal distance. Due to the lack of a third company, Taplett had
no reserve other than a handful of headquarters troops. Thus 3/5 got its<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
taste of things to come in a strange war of mountains and men.</p>

<p>As the riflemen were digging their hilltop holes with traditional distaste,
other supporting elements of the Brigade and 5th Marines began
to arrive at Chindong-ni and set up for business. These included the
Brigade Reconnaissance Company and a platoon of the regimental
4.2-inch Mortar Company.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> All Marine units in the area temporarily
came under control of 3/5’s Battalion Commander. Taplett was given
the added responsibility of handling all area requests for tactical air
support.<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a></p>

<p>For the time being, the 3d Battalion itself was under operational control
of Colonel John H. Michaelis, USA, commander of the 27th
Infantry “Wolfhounds.” Verbal instructions from Major General Kean
on 6 August had given the Army officer control of all troops in the
Chindong-ni area. When a second Marine battalion arrived in the locale,
command would then pass to General Craig.<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a></p>

<p>By 1600, Taplett had reported his command post location and defensive
positions to Michaelis. Immediately afterwards he ordered mortars
and artillery to lay registration fires on the northern approaches to
Chindong-ni.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> Having left the phantoms of Changwon far behind, the

<h3><i>First Platoon Fight</i></h3>

<p>Shortly after midnight, the 3d Battalion received an unexpected message
which precipitated the first Marine infantry action of the war. Colonel
Michaelis radioed Taplett and passed on a directive from 25th Division,
ordering the Marine battalion to commit immediately one reinforced
platoon for the defense of Hill 342. He explained that this unit was to
relieve a beleaguered Army company being slowly eaten away in a private
war of attrition. Taplett informed the regimental commander that
he could ill afford to spare 1 of his 6 rifle platoons, but was told in return
that General Kean had ordered 342 held at all costs.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a></p>

<p>Tagged with the ominous sounding name “Yaban-san” by Koreans,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
this hill resembles a huge molar whose roots rise from the MSR west of
Chindong-ni and lead to a tremendous mass about 2,000 yards north of
the road. There the ground climbs sharply, culminating in a peak 1,100
feet high. Beyond, a long saddle extends a few thousand yards northwest,
connecting 342 with a height of almost 2,000 feet. The latter was a
stronghold of NKPA 6th Division elements, making a determined bid
to carry 342 and cut the MSR.</p>

<p>Assigned the mission of making the Brigade’s first ground contact was
young Lieutenant Cahill of Company G. His 1st Platoon was reinforced
with a machinegun squad and SCR-300 operator before he led it from
3/5’s perimeter.</p>

<p>Moving westward on the MSR, the platoon reached Michaelis’ CP,
located near the bridges south of Hill 99. Cahill was told that he would
be met by a guide at a road junction 700 yards farther down the MSR.
From this point the platoon followed a soldier who escorted Cahill to
the CP of the 2d Battalion, 5th RCT. This headquarters was situated just
north of the road, on the tip of 342’s eastern “root,” 1 of the 2 long
ridges leading to the hill itself.</p>

<p>The Marine officer was told to relieve the Army company on the
summit and hold the hill with his platoon. Following a quick briefing,
Cahill and the guide led the column northward from the CP, skirting
the western base of the ridge. A few hundred yards along the way, the
guide discovered that he had miscalculated in the darkness. More time
was lost while the platoon descended to resume the correct route.</p>

<p>As the men threaded their way along the unseen trail, a few enemy
artillery shells burst nearby. The column reached the end of the valley
separating the two long spurs of 342, and a volley of rifle fire cracked in
the darkness. Two of Cahill’s Marines were painfully wounded.</p>

<p>Since the column was still in friendly territory, the guide advised
Cahill not to climb 342 until dawn shed light on the mystery. It was
then 0500, 7 August, and the Marine platoon had marched 3 miles from
its original position.</p>

<p>Shortly after first light, it was discovered that soldiers of the 2d Battalion,
5th RCT, had fired on the Marines, not realizing that friendly
units were moving within the area.</p>

<p>As the sun rose in a cloudless sky, Cahill took the lead. First, he
climbed the high ground joining 342 with its eastern spur, then crossed
over and continued toward the peak from a southeasterly direction.</p>

<div id="ip_107" class="figcenter land">
  <img src="images/i_107.jpg" width="2080" height="1360" alt="" />

<p class="small">SHOWING 1st PROV. MAR. BRIGADE’S DISPOSITION,
BLOCKING ACTION, &amp; LOCAL ATTACKS</p></div></div>

<p>The platoon made good progress at the outset, but the heat became
stifling; and all the while the slopes of 342 stretched ahead like a<span class="pagenum"><a class="hidep" id="Page_107">107</a><a id="Page_108">108</a></span>
continuous wall. Stumbling, gasping for breath, soaked with perspiration,
every Marine reached the point at which he barely managed to drag
himself up the steep incline. There were choked curses as men gained a
few feet, only to slip and fall back even farther.</p>

<p>Water discipline collapsed as canteens were quickly emptied. Marines
began to drop along the slope, some unconscious, others doubled over
and retching. The tactical formation of the platoon became ragged, but
Cahill and his NCO’s urged the men upward.</p>

<p>Accompanied by Sergeant Lee Buettner, Cahill set out to contact the
Army company commander on the summit and reconnoiter the area.
Seventy-five yards from the top, he was fired on from the eastern slopes.
Since he was in sight of the Army troops on the crest, it was obvious
that the North Korean People’s Army had officially greeted the 1st
Provisional Marine Brigade.</p>

<h3><i>The Perimeter on Hill 342</i></h3>

<p>Convinced that he was encountering only sniper fire, Cahill ordered
Buettner to stay behind and keep the platoon moving up a draw affording
cover. Then, ignoring enemy marksmen, the young officer climbed
up to the crest and entered a grim little company perimeter under constant
rifle and machinegun fire from its front and both flanks.</p>

<p>It was 0830 when the Army company commander greeted Cahill and
explained his defenses. It had been customary, he said, to man a broad
front during the day and draw back into a tight perimeter at night. But
the intense enemy fire of the previous night had not diminished after
daybreak, with the result that his men still occupied their night perimeter.
The Army officer added that he had returned his mortars to the base
of the hill, since they had drawn too much fire to be effective. Deployed
around a triangular perimeter conforming to the shape of 347’s peak
were the remnants of his three shattered platoons.</p>

<p>While Cahill appraised the situation, his platoon labored up the hill
under prodding by Buettner and other NCO’s. Well up the southeastern
slope, the column suddenly came under automatic weapons fire from
invisible enemy positions. The exhausted Marines set up weapons along
the hillside and fired at area targets. Despite the blistering sun and whine
of bullets, NCO’s led their fire teams and squads up toward the peak.</p>

<p>When the Marines reached Cahill, he learned that 1 man had been
killed and 6 wounded, including Staff Sergeant Robert Robinson, platoon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
sergeant, and Sergeant Thomas Blackmon, platoon guide. A number
of heat casualties were recuperating far down the slope, and one
Marine had suffered an emotional collapse. Blackmon, despite a mortal
wound, had been so intent on joining his platoon leader at the crest that
four weary men were required to carry him down the hillside to safety.
Three other able-bodied Marines also had to assist wounded men down
the hill.</p>

<p>Of the 52 men who had set out the previous night, only 37, including
those recovered from heat sickness, finally reached Cahill. As they assembled
on the reverse slope of 342, a group of soldiers on the crest broke
under a heavy volume of enemy fire and bolted from the perimeter. The
Army company was on the verge of panic until a young Army lieutenant
restored order and led the men back to their foxholes.</p>

<p>Cahill and his remaining NCO’s crawled around the perimeter to
insert Marines in positions among those of the Army troops. This psychology
was sound, for each infantryman, eyeing his Army or Marine
neighbor, prided himself on setting a high standard of military conduct.
From that time on, every man discharged his responsibility in a most
exemplary manner.</p>

<p>Two more Marines had been killed instantly while being led to their
positions by Sergeant Jack Macy. These casualties brought the platoon’s
total to 3 KIA and 8 WIA.</p>

<p>It is not likely that Cahill’s men were interested enough in historic
dates to recall that it was the eighth anniversary of the Marine landing
on Guadalcanal in World War II. For at noon, the fight on Hill 342 took
on aspects of a siege. Swarms of North Koreans inched upward toward
the crest, taking advantage of cover and concealment as they kept a steady
stream of rifle and machinegun fire cutting across the hilltop. Despite
the visual handicap resulting from the enemy’s use of smokeless powder,
the Marines and soldiers returned the fire with determination.</p>

<p>Due to the urgency of the situation on 342, the 2d Battalion, 5th RCT,
ordered its company to remain on the crest with Cahill’s platoon. Plans
were already underway for a larger Marine force to clear the high ground.</p>

<h3><i>Call for Artillery Fires</i></h3>

<p>In the meantime Cahill used his initiative to improve the situation. With
his SCR-300, he called for Army artillery fire to silence the Communist
mortars. When the first shells were fired for registration, he searched the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
perimeter and located an artillery forward observer. Accurate bursts were
laid on likely looking mortar OP’s in enemy territory, yet the Communist
tubes continued to fire.</p>

<p>With ammunition and water in critical supply, the Marine officer
radioed 3/5’s CP and requested an air drop. Taplett’s Tactical Air Control
Party relayed the message to the Brigade Air Section, and an Air Force
R4D transport flew over the restricted drop area atop Hill 342. The
precious supplies tumbled from the big plane—into enemy territory. A
single recovered packet contained carbine cartridges, the one type not
needed.</p>

<p>The Brigade Air Section then turned the mission over to VMO-6.
Every 5-gallon water can owned by the squadron was donated, and the
more maneuverable OY-2’s were able to drop them within the confined
perimeter. Unhappily, the containers burst upon striking the ground, so
that the parched hill defenders were able to salvage only a few mouthfuls
of water apiece.</p>

<p>Sergeant Macy reacted with vigor. With Cahill’s permission, he
organized a few volunteers into a patrol to search for water. Descending
the perilous southeastern slope under fire, the little group struck out for
the village of Taepyong-ni, located along the base of 342’s eastern spur
and facing Hill 99 across the valley.</p>

<p>As the afternoon wore on, the Army-Marine defenders clung to their
precarious perch, despite swollen tongues and Communist fire. The
enemy had succeeded in surrounding the entire peak with a ring of fire.
Several more casualties were inflicted on the infantry company, and a
Marine machinegunner was killed instantly by a sniper who had worked
his way to the south of the perimeter.</p>

<h3><i>Task Force Kean Stalled</i></h3>

<p>Although the night of 6–7 August had been uneventful for 3/5’s front
lines around Chindong-ni, Taplett’s CP near the base of Hill 255 came
under sporadic shelling between 0100 and 0400. The first messages from
Cahill, received about 0600, caused anxiety over the fate of his platoon.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_181" href="#FNanchor_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> Annex How.</p></div>

<p>At 0200 that morning, a long column of trucks had set out from
Changwon, carrying Lieutenant Colonel Harold S. Roise’s 2d Battalion,
5th Marines. The head of the convoy reached Chindong-ni about 0500<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
and entered the truck turn-around in a schoolyard at the base of Hill
255.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> As 2/5 unloaded, the turn-around became a bottleneck of vehicles,
men, and equipment which slowed movement on the MSR itself almost
to a standstill. To make matters worse, the heavy traffic gradually
pounded the schoolyard into a quagmire, so that trucks bogged down
and added to the confusion.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_182" href="#FNanchor_182" class="fnanchor">182</a> <i>Ibid.</i>; and LtCol H. S. Roise ltr to authors, 5 Feb 54 (Roise, 5 Feb 54).</p></div>

<p>While Roise was assembling his battalion, the entire area came under
heavy mortar and artillery fire from the north. The sudden shelling,
which caused 2/5’s first battle casualties, brought all traffic on the road
from Changwon to an abrupt halt.</p>

<p>Although the Marines of the 2d Battalion were well covered behind
Hill 255, bursts from shells striking the trees high on the ridge filled the
air with fragments. Before the enemy mortars ceased, 1 Marine had been
killed and 11 wounded, including Captain George E. Kittredge, Jr.,
commander of Company E.<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_183" href="#FNanchor_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Murray, whose headquarters was behind Roise’s
unit in the convoy, was still north of Chindong-ni when the column
slowed almost to a standstill. He radioed 2/5’s commander and told him
to keep the trucks moving despite the shelling. Roise replied that the
muddy schoolyard, not enemy fire, was the main cause of the delay. Thus
Murray received the first of many object lessons in Korean geography.
He sat patiently in his jeep, while the column inched into Chindong-ni.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_184" href="#FNanchor_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> Murray, 15 Feb 54.</p></div>

<p>After the regimental commander arrived in Chindong-ni, the 3d Battalion,
less Cahill’s platoon, reverted to his control. Because of the battle
in progress on Hill 342 and enemy activity to the north of the village
perimeter, Murray ordered 2/5 to occupy and defend an expanse of 255
above Company H’s positions. He directed 1/5 (following his headquarters
in the column from Changwon) to occupy Hill 99, thus relieving
Company G to bolster Taplett’s lines on lower 255.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_185" href="#FNanchor_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> Annex How.</p></div>

<p>General Craig arrived at Chindong-ni shortly after 0700, just in time
to be warmly greeted by the enemy shelling as he stepped from his helicopter.
Since the Brigade attack scheduled for 7 August hinged on the
5th RCT’s success at the Tosan junction, Craig quickly arranged for a
telephone line to that unit, so that his CP would be in constant contact.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_186" href="#FNanchor_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> LtGen E. A. Craig ltr to authors, 12 Jan 54 (Craig, 12 Jan 54).</p></div>

<p>News from the front was not good. At 0630, after air and artillery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
preparations, the 5th RCT had jumped off on schedule. Just beyond the
line of departure, it came to a sudden halt as a result of increased enemy
activity north of the road. Elements of the NKPA 6th Division, paying
little attention to the plans of Task Force Kean, had launched an attack
of their own above the MSR.</p>

<p>The situation on Hill 342 kept the entire 2d Battalion, 5th RCT, tied
down in a fight to hold the Chinju road open. With the help of Cahill’s
platoon on the crest, this mission was being accomplished; but the battalion
was temporarily lost to its regiment, and the road itself was
choked with men and vehicles unable to move.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_187" href="#FNanchor_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> Brig SAR, basic rpt.</p></div>

<h3><i>General Craig Assumes Control</i></h3>

<p>The Brigade was ordered to provide a battalion for the relief of the Army
unit on Yaban-san, so that the 5th RCT could strike harder at the road
junction 2½ miles to the west.<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_188" href="#FNanchor_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>Just as 2/5 was ascending Hill 255, Lieutenant Colonel Murray
received word from Brigade of the Marine commitment. The 5th Marines
commander canceled Roise’s orders and directed him to relieve
both Cahill’s platoon and the 2d Battalion, 5th RCT, and to seize the
remainder of Hill 342.<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_189" href="#FNanchor_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> <i>Ibid.</i>; and Annex How.</p></div>

<p>At 1120 on 7 August, General Craig received a telephone message
from General Kean directing the Brigade commander to assume control
of all troops in the Chindong-ni area until further orders. With this
overall responsibility, Craig went forward to observe the 5th RCT in
action. He ascertained by personal reconnaissance that enemy resistance
was light, although few friendly gains were being made because of the
scattered and confused nature of the fighting.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> The MSR between
Sangnyong-ni, at the base of Hill 342’s spurs, and the vital Tosan junction
was jammed with men, vehicles, and equipment, while infantrymen
probed the surrounding high ground in an effort to weed out snipers and
infiltrators.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_190" href="#FNanchor_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> Craig, 12 Jan 54.</p></div>

<p>When 2/5 reached the road junction at which Cahill had been met by
the Army guide during the night, Lieutenant Colonel Roise ordered
Company D to move up the north fork, tracing the base of 342’s eastern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
spur, and seize both the spur and great hill itself. Company E, now commanded
by 1st Lieutenant William E. Sweeney, was to pass behind
Sangnyong-ni and seize the west spur. Such a deployment would leave
the battalion spread thinly, but Roise’s orders were to protect the wide
valley formed by the two long ridges. This could be done only by occupying
both spurs and 342 itself.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_191" href="#FNanchor_191" class="fnanchor">191</a> Roise, 5 Feb 54.</p></div>

<p>Outside of Chindong-ni, Major Morgan J. McNeely, 2d Battalion
S-3, had picked up Captain John Finn, Jr., CO of Company D, and the
two officers drove ahead by jeep to the village of Taepyong-ni at the
eastern base of Hill 342. The staff officer informed Finn that Dog Company
was to relieve a 5th RCT unit on the high ground above the clump
of thatched huts. Both McNeely and an Army guide said that the Marines
would meet no organized resistance in their climb.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_192" href="#FNanchor_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> Capt J. Finn, Jr., ltr to authors, 1 Mar 54 (Finn, 1 Mar 54).</p></div>

<p>Having spent a sleepless night on the road from Changwon to Chindong-ni,
Finn’s infantrymen were fagged. It was now midafternoon, and
the heat began to take its toll of Dog Company.</p>

<p>Just as the leading elements reached Finn at Taepyong-ni—30 minutes
after McNeely’s departure—the column came under rifle and machinegun
fire from the high ground above the road and from the hamlet of
Tokkong-ni across the valley on the right. The Marines thought they
were being shot at by Army troops, but the chatter of Communist “burp
guns”<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> soon convinced them that they were meeting enemy resistance.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>Finn ordered his men into the rice paddies bordering the road. Calling
his platoon leaders, he told them that there was no real intelligence, but
that the fire from Tokkong-ni would be ignored due to the company’s
mission on 342. He assigned routes of ascent to each platoon. The 2d,
under Second Lieutenant Wallace J. Reid, would push through Taepyong-ni
and on up the hill at its juncture with the spur. On the left, Second
Lieutenant Edward T. Emmelman would lead his 3d Platoon to the top
of the spur. The 1st Platoon, commanded by Second Lieutenant Arthur
A. Oakley, would hold the right flank and ascend the southern slopes of
342 itself.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a></p>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_195" href="#FNanchor_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> <i>Ibid.</i>; and Finn, 1 Mar 54.</p></div>

<p>Company D met scattered opposition. By the time it moved over the
crest of the spur, five Marines had been wounded. The sun, however,
had been more effective; for twelve men were completely unconscious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
from the 100° heat, and the rest of the company had neared the point of
exhaustion.</p>

<p>Finn ordered his executive officer, First Lieutenant Robert T. Hanifin,
Jr., to set up headquarters and the 60-mm. mortars on the high ground
directly above Taepyong-ni. It was already early in the evening when
Hanifin established a thin perimeter of headquarters personnel to safeguard
the CP.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a></p>

<p>In the meantime, Finn was leading his three rifle platoons up the same
southeastern approach to 342’s summit which Cahill’s platoon had
scaled 12 hours earlier. The company commander could no longer overlook
the combined effects on his men of heat and overexertion. A few
hundred yards from the summit, he radioed Roise that Company D was
exhausted. During the halt, Lieutenant Oakley climbed to the summit
to contact the Army and Marine defenders. He returned just before dark
with Cahill and the Army company commander.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a></p>

<p>In the hurried conference that followed, the Army officer advised Finn
against finishing the rugged climb and assured him that his soldiers and
Cahill’s platoon could defend the peak through the night. Informed of
this by radio, Roise allowed Company D to hold its present position
and relieve at dawn.<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a></p>

<p>Earlier in the day, Lieutenant Sweeney had led Company E up the
lower tip of 342’s western spur, then along the ridgeline toward the
large hill mass. At intervals the company came under long range, ineffectual
machinegun fire. But, as in the case of Finn’s unit, the heat and
terrain were more damaging than enemy bullets. At dusk, Company E
had reached the midway point along the ridge, and there it dug in for
the night.</p>

<h3><i>Enemy Attack at Dawn</i></h3>

<p>Under cover of darkness, Red Korean troops wormed their way around
the little perimeter on the summit of Hill 342. Just before dawn the
soldiers and Marines were greeted by bursts of short-range rifle and machinegun
fire. The defenders returned the fire and hurled grenades down
the slopes, but a small force of North Koreans succeeded in crawling<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
close enough to launch an assault against the northeast leg of the
triangle.<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_199" href="#FNanchor_199" class="fnanchor">199</a> Cahill, 9 Dec 53.</p></div>

<p>A fierce hand-to-hand struggle ensued at the point of contact, and the
Communists were thrown back down the hill. One of Cahill’s men died
of bayonet and gunshot wounds, and another Marine and several soldiers
were wounded.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_200" href="#FNanchor_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>Finn’s men struck out for the summit shortly after daybreak on 8
August. With three platoons abreast along the southern face of 342,
Dog Company pushed upward swiftly, brushing aside light resistance.
Upon reaching the perimeter, the Marines came under a storm of fire
from NK positions which ringed the northern half of the hill.<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a></p>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_201" href="#FNanchor_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> Finn, 1 Mar 54; and Roise, 5 Feb 54.</p></div>

<p>The relief was effected, nevertheless, and Cahill’s thinned squads
descended Hill 342 together with the shattered Army company. The
Marine platoon had lost 6 killed and 12 wounded—more than a third of
the 52 men who had set out from Chindong-ni.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> But its determined
stand with the beleaguered Army unit had saved the height and frustrated
the Communist attempts to establish a bastion overlooking the
MSR.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_202" href="#FNanchor_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> Annex Able to Annex How.</p></div>

<p>Company D fared no better than its predecessors at consolidating the
crest of 342 and clearing upper slopes which were crawling with North
Koreans. Finn’s unit took several casualties in the fire fight that accompanied
and followed the relief of the original defenders. Two of those
killed in action were Second Lieutenants Oakley and Reid. The only surviving
platoon leader, Lieutenant Emmelman, received a serious head
wound as he was pointing out targets to a Marine machinegunner.<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a></p>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_203" href="#FNanchor_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> Finn, 1 Mar 54; and Hanifin, 15 Feb 54.</p></div>

<p>Captain Finn, seeing Reid’s motionless form lying ahead of the company
lines, crawled forward to recover the body. Having moved only a
short distance with his burden, the company commander himself was
struck in the head and shoulder by enemy bullets. Barely conscious and
almost blinded by blood, Finn crept back to his lines on his hands and
knees.</p>

<p>A corpsman administered first aid and Company D’s first sergeant
helped the officer down the steep slope.<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a> On the way the pair met Lieutenant
Hanifin, who was leading company headquarters and the mortar<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
section to the high ground from their positions of the previous night.
Finn informed the executive officer that he was now in command of the
company.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a></p>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_205" href="#FNanchor_205" class="fnanchor">205</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>Reaching the summit, Hanifin had just enough time to reorganize his
defensive positions and emplace the 60-mm. mortars before the Communists
launched another attack. Again Marine rifles, machineguns, and
grenades scorched the northern slopes. Again the enemy was beaten
back, leaving the hillside littered with dead. But Company D’s casualties
had mounted meanwhile to 6 killed in action and 25 wounded.<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a></p>

(Zimmer, 18 Feb 54). This breakdown of casualties is as nearly correct as can be ascertained
from recollections of participants and a comparison with the final total given after
2/5 was relieved on position.</p></div>

<p>About 1130, as the fire fight slackened, Roise phoned Hanifin from
his OP on the eastern spur. The conversation had no sooner begun
when the company commander collapsed from heat exhaustion. A veteran
NCO and a young officer promptly filled the command vacuum.
Company D’s gunnery sergeant, Master Sergeant Harold Reeves, assumed
control of the three rifle platoons with the confidence of long
experience. Second Lieutenant Leroy K. Wirth, a forward observer of
1/11, took responsibility for all supporting arms, including the planes
of MAG-33 circling overhead. The NCO of almost 30 years service and
the young officer repeatedly ranged forward of the front lines to spot
enemy positions for air strikes and make new appraisals of the situation.
Company D remained steady, and never again did the North Koreans
seriously threaten the hilltop.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_207" href="#FNanchor_207" class="fnanchor">207</a> Hanifin, 15 Feb 54.</p></div>

<p>The 2d Battalion, 24th Infantry, was scheduled to relieve 2/5 on Hill
342 during the afternoon of 8 August; but the Army unit was unable to
reach the area for reasons to be explained later. Informed of the change
in plans, Roise kept his battalion busy with consolidation of positions
and evacuation of casualties.</p>

<p>Company E moved forward a few hundred yards along the western
spur of 342 and dug new foxholes. Captain Andrew M. Zimmer reported
from regiment, where he had been an assistant S-3, and took command
of Company D.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_208" href="#FNanchor_208" class="fnanchor">208</a> Annex How.</p></div>

<p>Although the North Koreans continued to harass the “iron triangle”
on the crest, there was no more hard fighting. A few additional casualties
were taken by Zimmer’s company, most of them occurring while Marines<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
tried to retrieve airdropped supplies which had fallen wide of their
mark.<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a></p>

<p>During the fighting on 342, Major Walter Gall, commander of 2/5’s
Weapons Company, had dispatched a small patrol to eliminate the enemy
machineguns in Tokkong-ni. After a brief fire fight which cost three
friendly casualties, the withdrawal of the patrol left the Communists still
entrenched in the village. When the Marines returned to Weapons Company
lines on the eastern spur, First Lieutenant Ira T. Carr turned his
81-mm. mortars on Tokkong-ni and brought the enemy fire to an end.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_210" href="#FNanchor_210" class="fnanchor">210</a> Maj Walter Gall interv with authors, 9 Feb 54.</p></div>

<p>The night of 8–9 August was relatively quiet on 342. Obviously
weakened by casualties, the enemy gave the Marine positions a wide
berth. NKPA harassing fires consisted of periodic bursts from long-range
machineguns and antitank guns.<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a> There was desultory sniping during
the morning of the 9th, but Brigade intelligence reported a gradual
withdrawal of the enemy northward.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a></p>

<p>That afternoon Company D was relieved by an Army unit when 2/5
turned over responsibility for the hill to the 2d Battalion, 24th Infantry.
The fight had made veterans out of the men Zimmer led down to the
road, but the company paid with 8 dead and 28 wounded.<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a></p>

<p>Documents taken from enemy dead disclosed that the defenders of
Hill 342 had been opposed by elements of the 13th and 15th Regiments
of the NK 6th Division. Lieutenant Cahill qualified his report of 150
enemy dead as “conservative,”<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a> and 2/5 set the total at 400 after its
fight.<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a> The actual number of fatalities inflicted by Marine-Army infantry
and supporting arms probably lies somewhere between these two
estimates.</p>

<p>At any rate, the Red Korean commander had committed at least two
rifle companies supported by machineguns, mortars and artillery. The
force thrown against Yaban-san could be estimated at 500 to 600 troops,
and they had failed in their attempt to cut the MSR.<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">While 2/5 and</span> the 1st Platoon of Company G were fighting the
enemy and weather on 7 August, Lieutenant Colonel Taplett’s 3d
Battalion sat out an ominous calm at Chindong-ni. From their positions
on Hills 253 and 99, Captain Fegan and Lieutenant Bohn periodically
called for supporting fires to check enemy movement in the northern
approaches to the village.</p>

<p>At 1015 Second Lieutenant Lawrence W. Hetrick and his 3d Platoon,
Company A Engineers, completed the laying of the first Marine minefield,
located across the Haman road a half mile above Chindong-ni.<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a></p>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_217" href="#FNanchor_217" class="fnanchor">217</a> Annex How.</p></div>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Newton’s 1st Battalion reached the village in the
afternoon of the 7th and relieved Company G’s two platoons on Hill 99.
Bohn took his company back across the valley and deployed on the
lower slopes of 255 facing the Haman road. These positions were hit by
close-in sniper fire during the night of 7–8 August, and at dawn the Marine
infantrymen were startled to discover four NK soldiers emplaced
less than 100 yards away in the valley. Both the enemy position and its
occupants were quickly destroyed.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a></p>

<p>Shortly after daybreak on 8 August—while Cahill was being relieved
on Yaban-san—the Marines of Company H noted a column of troops
climbing Hill 255 from the direction of the Haman road. Believing the
newcomers to be ROK soldiers, Fegan’s men watched as the long file
reached the high peak beyond the plateau forward of the Marine positions.
When the group set up facing Company H, Fegan became skeptical
enough to alert his riflemen and machinegunners. His precautions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
were timely, for the visitors immediately opened fire on the Marines.<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_219" href="#FNanchor_219" class="fnanchor">219</a> Fegan, 17 Apr 54.</p></div>

<p>This surprise attack had a critical effect on the Task Force Kean sector.
In possession of the high ground above 3/5, the North Koreans
were able to block the Masan-Chindong-ni stretch of the MSR, leaving
most of the American ground forces out on a limb for supply and reinforcement
purposes. Thus when the 2d Battalion, 24th Infantry, advanced
from Masan to relieve both 3/5 and 2/5 on their respective hills,
it was driven off the fire-swept road north of Chindong-ni.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_220" href="#FNanchor_220" class="fnanchor">220</a> Brig SAR, basic rpt; and Craig, 12 Jan 54.</p></div>

<p>Upon being informed of the enemy’s presence, Taplett ordered Company
H to attack and destroy the Communist position. Fegan called
his two platoon leaders<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a> while the Marine infantrymen in the line
exchanged shots with the enemy across the plateau. After a quick briefing,
Second Lieutenant John O. Williams led his 1st Platoon to the
long tableland.<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_221" href="#FNanchor_221" class="fnanchor">221</a> The 2d Platoon was still in position east of the MSR.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_222" href="#FNanchor_222" class="fnanchor">222</a> Fegan, 17 Apr 54.</p></div>

<p>Echeloned to the right, the skirmish line pushed aggressively over the
open area, firing on the enemy as it moved forward. The platoon closed
to within 30 yards of the Communist-held peak, but showers of hand
grenades and continuous machinegun fire pinned down the attackers.
Fegan sent a message forward, directing Williams to work around the
enemy’s left flank. Although one fire team succeeded in reaching the
rocks below the NK positions, the flanking maneuver failed.</p>

<h3><i>Heavy NKPA Resistance</i></h3>

<p>The 3d Platoon had taken several casualties. Marines still in the open
area were unable to advance, while those who had attempted the envelopment
could only cling to the steep slopes above the MSR. When
some of this group were struck by enemy fire, the impact sent them rolling
helplessly down the sharp incline.</p>

<p>Convinced that Williams could not carry the peak, Fegan ordered
him to pull his platoon back toward the line of departure and reorganize.
While the withdrawal was in progress, the company commander
ordered the 3d Platoon to pass through the 1st and continue the attack.
There was no response to the order.<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_223" href="#FNanchor_223" class="fnanchor">223</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>Fegan realized that the men were momentarily unnerved after witnessing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
the failure of the first attack. The company commander, therefore,
assumed control and personally led the 3rd Platoon forward on the
plateau. Halfway across the open area, the new skirmish line passed
through Williams’ outfit as it was reforming.</p>

<p>The Marines of the 3d Platoon responded with confidence to Fegan’s
leadership. They crossed the tableland in a wedge formation with 1
squad at the apex and the other 2 slightly withheld. Air strikes and artillery
preparations had little effect against the rocky crag beyond the
plateau, so that the final assault was fought to a finish with small arms
and grenades.<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_224" href="#FNanchor_224" class="fnanchor">224</a> <i>Ibid.</i>; and Annex How.</p></div>

<p>Staff Sergeant John I. Wheatley, one of the prime movers, fell
wounded along with several of his men. Sergeant Edward F. Barrett,
shot in the elbow and hip, lay helpless, exposed to enemy fire, until Captain
Fegan carried him back to safety.</p>

<p>The 3d Platoon gained the rocky summit and worked its way through
the NKPA position, a foxhole at a time, while the enemy resisted to the
death. Corporal Melvin James<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a> hit the Red Korean left flank with his
squad and drove deep into the enemy position. The NKPA right flank
was rolled up by a vigorous assault sparked by Technical Sergeant Ray
Morgan and Private First Class Donald Terrio<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a> as each knocked out a
Communist machinegun and its crew.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_225" href="#FNanchor_225" class="fnanchor">225</a> James was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for this action.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_226" href="#FNanchor_226" class="fnanchor">226</a> Morgan and Terrio received Silver Star medals.</p></div>

<p>Having wiped out the main enemy position, the 3d Platoon advanced
northward about 200 yards to a gulf where the high ground fell away
abruptly. Beyond this depression rose the highest step of the ridgeline’s
rugged staircase: Hill 255 with a height of mote than 800 feet above the
MSR. The three squads held up here to await further orders.</p>

<p>How Company’s fight up to this time had cost the Marines 6 dead
and 32 wounded.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a></p>

<h3><i>Assault on Hill 255</i></h3>

<p>A column of NKPA reinforcements bound for Hill 255 was spotted
during the action by Company G from its positions facing the Haman
road. The enemy platoon struck out across the valley from the high
ground north of Hill 99, then attempted to ascend 255 via the same
route used by comrades at dawn.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
The Marines of Company G and their supporting arms cut loose with
a hurricane of fire. And after scattering in panic, the enemy survivors
scuttled back to their starting point.<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_228" href="#FNanchor_228" class="fnanchor">228</a> Bohn, 17 Apr 54.</p></div>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Murray, upon being informed of the progress
made by How Company, directed Taplett to halt the attack and dig in
for the night. While Fegan’s men were carrying out this order under
NKPA artillery and mortar fire, MAG-33 and the Marine artillery roared
into action. The saddle north of How Company’s lines was pounded so
mercilessly that the enemy pulled back from Fegan’s immediate front.
Throughout the night of 8–9 August, 1/11 and 3/5’s mortar platoon
dropped a steel curtain across the battalion front, with the result that
no enemy activity was noted.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>The systematic reduction of enemy positions on Hill 255 the next
morning was a triumph of supporting arms. Marine artillery shells led
off at 0825, followed by Marine air which worked the enemy over with
the first close-support payload of napalm recorded so far in the Korean
conflict. And four minutes before Company H launched its final attack
on the hill, airborne TAC reported the objective neutralized.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_230" href="#FNanchor_230" class="fnanchor">230</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>Fegan’s men scaled the peak against negligible opposition. Two
knocked-out machineguns and a few enemy dead were all that remained
at the summit.<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a></p>

<p>The plan for eliminating the threat to the MSR called for a Marine
advance along Hill 255 to grid line 1350. North of this boundary, the
ridge would be cleared by Army troops approaching from Masan.</p>

<p>Company H sighted soldiers of the 24th Infantry at 1125 as they
moved southward to the grid line, and the long ridge was considered
secure. It had been no light price, however, that 3/5 paid to open the
MSR. Casualties on Hill 255 totalled 16 dead and 36 wounded, and since
nearly all had been taken by Company H, Fegan’s outfit was reduced by
25 percent.<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a></p>

<p>On the whole, Task Force Kean’s scheduled drive on Chinju and
Sachon had not met with much success during the first 48 hours. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
only advance was made on the right, where the 35th Infantry seized its
first objective and inflicted an estimated 350 casualties on the enemy.<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a></p>

<p>In his capacity as provisional commander of all units along the Masan-Chinju
axis, General Craig was directing the Army operations at the
front and in the rear areas of the Task Force sector. Thus on 8 August
he ordered the 5th RCT to continue its attack and take Tosan, so that
his Marines could make progress on the road to Sachon.</p>

<p>After preparatory fires, the Army regiment again pushed forward toward
its immediate objective. Enemy resistance was much heavier than
on the day before; nevertheless, some gains were made from the starting
point near the village of Singi. The attack was also slowed by the narrow
MSR carrying the entire traffic load for the Task Force. Heavy fighting
above the road on Hills 255 and 342 added to the congestion and
confusion on the vital artery.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Newton’s 1st Battalion, 5th Marines, had been
ordered to move forward from Chindong-ni at 0600, 8 August, with the
mission of attacking along the south fork of the Tosan junction preparatory
to seizing a regimental objective which would be designated later.<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a></p>

(Newton, 3 Jan 54).</p></div>

<p>Leaving its positions on Hill 99 at the assigned time, the battalion
was stalled immediately at the bridges on the MSR below. The road was
still clogged with soldiers and Army vehicles, making it impossible for
the Marine unit to proceed.<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_235" href="#FNanchor_235" class="fnanchor">235</a> LtCol M. R. Olson, interv with author, 30 Dec 53 (Olson, 30 Dec 53).</p></div>

<p>General Craig, who was in the vicinity, told Newton to hold up until
the situation at the front became clarified. Company B, commanded by
Captain John L. Tobin, was ordered back up on the hill it had just descended;
and the battalion waited, three miles from its line of
departure.<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_236" href="#FNanchor_236" class="fnanchor">236</a> Col G. R. Newton, ltr to author, 19 Jan 54 (Newton, 19 Jan 54).</p></div>

<p>Finally the word came to move up. While 1/5 worked its way along
the crowded road, Newton walked ahead and reached the CP of the 1st
Battalion, 5th RCT, located on a hillside between Singi and Oryong.
There he learned that the Army unit’s companies were already on the
high ground all around the junction and that the rice paddies between
the battalion CP and these companies were full of North Koreans. The
Army commander considered his subordinate units cut off.<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span></p>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_237" href="#FNanchor_237" class="fnanchor">237</a> Newton, 3 Jan 54; and Olson, 30 Dec 53.</p></div>

<p>Shortly afterwards, at about 1400, the head of 1/5’s column reached
Newton and again came to a halt, a mile and a half from its line of departure.</p>

<p>Arriving on the scene at this time was a dispirited Army staff sergeant,
dripping with mud and water. He said that he had just returned from
Hill 308, south of the road junction, where his unit was heavily engaged
with the enemy. And he added that Communist machineguns covering
the wide rice paddy between 308 and the MSR had forced him to crawl
almost the whole distance.<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a></p>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Murray, while driving from Chindong-ni to the
front, was stopped on the road by Major General Kean himself. The
25th Division commander directed the Marine officer to arrange for a
night relief of the 1st Battalion, 5th RCT. Kean stated that he would inform
Brigade headquarters of this change in plans as soon as possible.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_239" href="#FNanchor_239" class="fnanchor">239</a> Col R. L. Murray, ltr to author, 7 Jan 54 (Murray, 7 Jan 54).</p></div>

<p>It had become a question as to whether Task Force Kean or the
NKPA 6th Division controlled Tosan. Newton radioed the 5th Marines
commander and asked for enlightenment. Murray, having just finished
his conversation with General Kean, ordered the battalion commander
to postpone the jumpoff until nightfall.<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a></p>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_240" href="#FNanchor_240" class="fnanchor">240</a> Newton, 3 Jan 54; and Olson, 30 Dec 53.</p></div>

<p>After withdrawing to the outskirts of Sangnyong-ni, 1/5 went into an
assembly area beneath the western spur of Hill 342. There the battalion
commander received specific orders to relieve the 1st Battalion, 5th
RCT, on positions southwest of Tosan at midnight, 8 August, and secure
the troublesome road junction once and for all.<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a></p>

<p>Newton was to have his battalion at the Army CP no later than 2300,
when it would be furnished guides to lead the way across the broad rice
paddy to Hill 308. As it proved, the Marine unit actually reached the
designated rendezvous at 2200. But even though an hour early, Newton
discovered that the soldiers on 308 were already withdrawing. Moreover,
no guides had been provided.<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p>The Marine battalion continued westward through Singi and stopped
on the MSR about a half-mile short of Tosan. Here a narrow dike
branched south from the road, and the soldiers were returning along this
trail from Hill 308 to the MSR. Since the footpath was pointed out as
Newton’s route of approach, he had little choice but to wait until the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
Army troops made the crossing. This was accomplished shortly after
midnight, and the column of Marines was left alone in the night on unfamiliar
ground reported to be crawling with enemy.<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_243" href="#FNanchor_243" class="fnanchor">243</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>The promised guides reported for duty at this time. They turned out
to be two South Korean civilians. Without further ado, the advance on
Sachon was launched when a long single file of skeptical Marines fell in
behind two unknown natives whose loyalty had to be accepted on faith.</p>

<p>Following the 1,200-yard trail in the darkness was time-consuming as
well as nerve-chilling. A misstep on the narrow, slippery dike usually
meant a spill into the muck and filth of the paddy for some hapless infantryman.
Not only would he delay all those behind, but he would not
be as fragrant as a rose in the nostrils of his comrades when he regained
the dike.</p>

<p>Finally the head of the file reached the base of Hill 308, having encountered
not a single enemy on the way. As more and more men
threaded their way in from the paddy, tactical integrity was slowly regained.
Dawn of 9 August was already breaking when the rear of the
column completed the crossing.<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_244" href="#FNanchor_244" class="fnanchor">244</a> Olson, 30 Dec 53.</p></div>

<p>Daybreak brought a radio message from Murray, directing 1/5 to continue
the attack to the southwest immediately and seize Hill 308. With
Tobin’s company leading, the battalion ascended the northern slopes in
a long column. The climb took the Marines more than 1,000 feet upward
and 2,000 yards to the south. Before the summit was reached, the
relentless sun and terrain had taken its toll of Newton’s infantrymen.
Fortunately, enemy resistance amounted to mere sniping; and by noon,
9 August, the massive terrain feature belonged to the Brigade.<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_245" href="#FNanchor_245" class="fnanchor">245</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>At 1700 that afternoon Craig’s operational control of all troops in the
area came to a close. At the end of the 54-hour period of the Marine general’s
overall command, the road junction had been cleared, and both
Army and Marine columns were making progress toward the objective.</p>

<h3><i>Brigade Artillery in Support</i></h3>

<p>Nearly all the infantry actions of the first 3 days owed a good deal to the
support of the 1st Battalion, 11th Marines. Consisting of three 4-gun<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
batteries, Lieutenant Colonel Ransom M. Wood’s outfit had relieved the
8th Field Artillery Battalion at Chindong-ni on the eve of D-day. Since
the terrain afforded no suitable alternate areas, the Marine gunners
moved into the positions vacated by the Army artillery, partly in the village
and partly on the outskirts.</p>

<p>A total of 87 rounds were fired that first night in support of the 5th
Marines, with the FO’s reporting good results. Before long, however,
enemy counterbattery fires searched out friendly positions in the village.
Early the next morning a Marine battery took a direct hit from an
NKPA 122-mm. shell. Two men were killed and 8 wounded by a blast
which destroyed a 105-mm. howitzer. Thus, reversing the usual rule,
the artillery suffered heavier casualties than the infantry at the jumpoff
of the Brigade attack.<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_246" href="#FNanchor_246" class="fnanchor">246</a> Annex Item to Brig SAR.</p></div>

<p>The gunners needed no further admonitions to dig foxholes, gunpits
and ammunition pits. During the confused fighting around Chindong-ni,
it was not unusual to have one battery laid on an azimuth generally
east, another west, and a third to the north.</p>

<p>“I think that this is one of the most important lessons we learned in
fighting infiltrating troops,” commented Wood; “artillery must be able
and always prepared to fire in any direction on a moment’s notice.”<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_247" href="#FNanchor_247" class="fnanchor">247</a> LtCol Ransom M. Wood, “Artillery Support for the Brigade in Korea,” <cite>Marine Corps
Gazette</cite>, 35, No. 6:16–17 (Jun 51).</p></div>

<p>From 7 to 9 August, with the battalion displacing forward as the infantry
advanced, 89 missions and 1,892 rounds were fired. Targets consisted
largely of enemy mortar positions. The terrain offered some knotty
problems in firing close support missions, due to steep slopes; but the
OY’s of VMO-6 did a good job of spotting.</p>

<p>Fifty ROK policemen were attached to 1/11 at this time to be used
as security troops. Wearing bright green uniforms and rubber shoes
upon arrival, they became the responsibility of the battalion to feed,
equip and train in marksmanship, sanitation and ammunition handling.
The rice-eating Koreans turned up their noses at American food for a
few days, but soon they could compete with any chow-hounds in the
outfit.<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_248" href="#FNanchor_248" class="fnanchor">248</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>Another difficulty was experienced in convincing the newcomers that
NKPA prisoners were to be brought in alive. Many personal scores remained
to be paid off in war-torn Korea, but eventually the ROK’s
learned to control their hatred for the invaders.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span></p>

<h3><i>Encounter With Japanese Maps</i></h3>

<p>As the men of 1/5 were consolidating their hilltop and searching for
water to relieve heat prostration cases, Murray radioed Newton to withdraw
his unit to the road below and continue the attack to Paedun-ni.
The regimental commander was determined to speed up the advance to
the south, since intelligence had reported no enemy on the high ground
south of Hill 308.<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_249" href="#FNanchor_249" class="fnanchor">249</a> Murray, 7 Jan 54.</p></div>

<p>With almost half of Companies A and B stricken by heat sickness,
Newton had no choice but to leave them in position on the high
ground for the time being. He descended the hill to form a tactical column
with Headquarters and Weapons Companies and an attached platoon
of tanks.</p>

<p>Reaching the low ground northwest of Hill 308, the battalion commander
discovered that his Japanese maps, as usual, bore only a slight
resemblance to the actual ground.</p>

<p>During the early weeks in Korea, the map situation was a thorn in
the side of every tactical commander. Not only were maps of local areas
extremely scarce, but the few available were of early Japanese vintage,
almost consistently at variance with the terrain. Grid systems were confusing,
villages misnamed and misplaced, and roads either not illustrated
at all or else plotted inaccurately. Lack of contouring left the conformation
and extent of ridges entirely to the imagination of the map
reader. These shortcomings were a constant source of concern; for troop
leaders often were misled, even to the extent of getting completely lost.</p>

<p>On the ground itself, there is an intersection called Oso-ri some 600
yards south of the Tosan junction. The routes leading both south and
west from this crossroads go to Paedun-ni. An unimproved road, the
southward passage is more rugged, while the other, being good by Korean
standards, follows a smoother course through the town of Taesil-li.</p>

<p>Newton’s map showed only the latter improved road, so he formed
his column and headed it toward Taesil-li, a thousand yards west of the
intersection.<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a> Murray’s map showed both roads, but in this case the
southern route was erroneously drawn in as the better road. It was thus
Murray’s intention that 1/5 use this avenue of approach. And since he
had spoken of it as the “improved” road, Newton was misled into
choosing the route to Taesil-li.<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span></p>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_251" href="#FNanchor_251" class="fnanchor">251</a> <i>Ibid.</i>; and Murray, 7 Jan 54.</p></div>

<p>The quickly formed column of tanks and infantry had gone only a few
hundred yards when the point stopped at a stretch of road littered with
land mines. A call went out for a demolitions team. From his CP near
Chindong-ni, Captain George W. King dispatched his 1st Platoon, Able
Company Engineers. Arriving at the scene, the Marine troubleshooters
discovered the obstacles to be merely American antitank mines, apparently
spilled on the road from an Army vehicle.</p>

<p>About this time. Lieutenant Colonel Murray arrived at Oso-ri and informed
1/5’s commander that he was on the wrong road. Newton reasoned
that his unit was following the correct route. After comparing the
conflicting maps, the regimental commander studied the terrain and directed
Newton to pull his column back and take the road to the south.
Then Murray returned to Sangnyong-ni, climbed into an observation
plane, and was flown over the route to confirm his decision.<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_252" href="#FNanchor_252" class="fnanchor">252</a> Murray, 7 Jan 54.</p></div>

<p>There was no small amount of confusion as the long column of tanks,
infantrymen, and engineers pulled back along the narrow road to
the intersection. And it was unfortunate for 1/5 that General Craig
reached the area while the milling was at its worst. Unaware of what
had taken place earlier, the Brigade commander did not refer to the delay
and congestion in the most soothing terms.<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_253" href="#FNanchor_253" class="fnanchor">253</a> Craig, 12 Jan 54.</p></div>

<p>While the column was being reformed on the southern road, villagers
from Taesil-li informed the Marines that a badly wounded American was
lying in the hamlet. Craig’s jeep driver sped to the clump of thatched
huts and returned with a soldier who was more dead than alive, having
been left behind by retreating NKPA forces. The man was rushed to the
rear for medical attention, while Craig stayed forward to supervise the
attack.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_254" href="#FNanchor_254" class="fnanchor">254</a> <i>Ibid.</i>; and Newton, 19 Jan 54.</p></div>

<p>The long file of Marines and tanks began moving southward along
the winding road below Hill 308. Newton had notified his company
commanders of the change, so that they could meet him by descending
the western slope of the high ground.</p>

<p>About a mile south of the confusing intersection, the point of 1/5’s
column rounded a sharp curve. It was greeted by a lone North Korean
machinegun hidden in a native hut at the center of the bend. While a
Marine brigadier watched with professional satisfaction, a team of infantrymen
with a rocket launcher closed on the hut and quickly destroyed
the enemy position.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
It was late afternoon as the column resumed its march to the south.
Covering several hundred more yards without incident, it reached the
top of a 400-foot pass where the road knifed between Hills 308 and 190.
There Newton was joined by Companies A and B from Objective
One.<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a> The 1st Battalion was ordered to hold up and take defensive positions
astride the pass.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_255" href="#FNanchor_255" class="fnanchor">255</a> Olson, 30 Dec 53.</p></div>

<p>Thus, the drive toward Sachon had finally taken shape, and the Brigade
was entering its own zone of responsibility. As darkness fell on 9
August, 1/5 was in position 2 miles south of the Tosan line of departure,
and General Craig had already set in motion plans for a night attack.</p>

<h3><i>Ambush at Taedabok Pass</i></h3>

<p>On 9 August the Brigade commander was convinced that the absence
of resistance in 1/5’s path indicated unpreparedness on the part of the
enemy. To exploit the advantage, he ordered Murray to execute a night
attack and capture Paedun-ni before daylight, 10 August.<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_256" href="#FNanchor_256" class="fnanchor">256</a> Brig Op Plan 7-50.</p></div>

<p>At 1600 on 9 August, the Brigade was relieved of mopping up duties
in the Chindong-ni area, leaving 2/5 immediately available to the 5th
Marines commander. The 3d Battalion was delayed overnight by several
hours of security duty until Army units could take over.<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_257" href="#FNanchor_257" class="fnanchor">257</a> This section is derived from: Annex How; Craig, 12 Jan 54; Zimmer, 18 Feb 54;

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Roise’s battalion, having been relieved on Hill
342, entrucked at Sangnyong-ni in the evening and reached its assembly
area near Hill 308 at 2100. Two hours later the unit marched southward
on the new MSR to make the night attack on Paedun-ni. Passing
through 1/5’s lines at 0115, 10 August, the weary Marines pressed on
toward their target against no resistance.</p>

<p>The point of the column included three M-26’s of First Lieutenant
William D. Pomeroy’s tank platoon. At 0500, with the advance elements
only a short distance from Paedun-ni, the lead tank crashed
through a concrete bridge. The badly damaged vehicle proved to be
wedged immovably between the two abutments.</p>

<p>The second tank, while attempting to negotiate a narrow bypass next
to the bridge, threw a track in the center of the stream and stalled the
long column behind. Two hours elapsed before the advance could be<span class="pagenum"><a class="hidep" id="Page_130">130</a><a id="Page_131">131</a></span>
resumed. South Korean laborers constructed a bypass for light vehicles
next to the bridge, and an engineer tractor-dozer arrived to build a
detour for heavy trucks and tanks.</p>

<div id="ip_130" class="figcenter land">

  <div class="caption"><p>SACHON OFFENSIVE</p>
  <p class="smaller">SITUATION MAP FOR
  8–10 AUG. ’50</p></div></div>

<p>Reaching Paedun-ni at 0800, 2/5 reconnoitered the town and found it
clear of enemy. By 0930 the battalion column was reformed and pounding
the dusty road south.</p>

<p>Murray decided to shuttle troops by truck from Paedun-ni to Kosong,
since the 8-mile stretch was believed to be free of enemy. The heavier
vehicles being tied up at the collapsed bridge, some delay resulted in
motorizing the first increment of 2/5.</p>

<p>General Craig arrived on the scene by helicopter in mid-morning.
Not satisfied with the progress of the advance, he ordered Murray and
Roise to march on Kosong with “all speed.” When the infantry column
was a short distance out of Paedun-ni, the 5th Marines commander
managed to get five 2½-ton trucks forward to help transport the first
serial to the target.</p>

<p>A motorized column was formed of 4 lead jeeps carrying a Reconnaissance
Company detachment, followed by part of Company D aboard
6 more jeeps and the 5 trucks. Owing to the shortage of vehicles, Captain
Zimmer’s first echelon included only the 1st and 2d Platoons, the
60-mm. mortars, an assault squad, and one machinegun section.</p>

<p>Lacking either air or artillery support, the column rolled southward
with orders to occupy Kosong and coordinate a defense of the city with
its mayor. The remainder of 2/5 continued on foot until more vehicles
could be provided.</p>

<p>The road makes a sharp turn 2½ miles southwest of Paedun-ni to
climb through Taedabok Pass, a defile about 1,000 yards long. Just
beyond, at the village of Pugok, a sharp turn to the left skirts the base
of a large hill overlooking the entire length of the pass.</p>

<p>The first jeep of the reconnaissance detachment was almost abreast of
Pugok at 1500 when NKPA machineguns opened up from the big hill
at the bend. Enemy automatic weapons on the high ground above the
pass raked the vehicles filled with Dog Company men.</p>

<p>As the Marines were taking cover in roadside ditches, a Communist
antitank gun opened fire from the large hill and hit one of the jeeps. The
reconnaissance troops gradually withdrew from their exposed positions
and fell back on Zimmer’s group. After sizing up the situation, the Company
D commander ordered his 1st Platoon to seize the high ground on
the right side of the road about midway through the pass. No resistance
was met, so that the Marines set up their weapons quickly and returned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
the Communist fire. Meanwhile the 2d Platoon moved up on the right
after clearing small enemy groups from the high ground on both sides
of the road at the entrance to the defile.</p>

<p>Zimmer had spotted the location of the enemy’s antitank gun, and
Marine 60-mm. fire put an end to this nuisance. The effort used up all
the mortar ammunition, and the Company D commander decided to wait
in position for Brigade supporting arms. Two tanks arrived at 1630, and
their 90-mm. guns drove the enemy into hiding.</p>

<p>While Marine tanks and air were working over the hill, 3/5 reached
Paedun-ni after being relieved of its final security mission in the
Chindong-ni area. Murray ordered Taplett to be prepared to pass
through 2/5 and continue the attack.</p>

<p>The 3d Battalion reached the entrance to Taedabok Pass in trucks
shortly after the arrival of the 2d Battalion troops who had followed
their motorized column on foot. Some confusion resulted on the narrow
road after Murray’s arrival while he waited to confer with Taplett.
Unable to find Roise, the two officers climbed the high ground on the
left. From this vantage point they could see Kosong, 5 miles away. The
regimental commander ordered Taplett to pass through 2/5 immediately
and continue the attack.</p>

<p>Company G had already crossed the line of departure and was deploying
to assault the hill at the road bend when Murray located Roise in
Zimmer’s area to the right of the road. The exact location of enemy
positions remained in some doubt. In order to clear up the uncertainty,
Major McNeely volunteered to lead out a patrol. About 1730, therefore,
Roise’s S/3 took off in a jeep with a radio operator and a fire team from
Dog Company.</p>

<p>By this time, Taplett had a fairly accurate picture of the situation in
mind. From his OP on the high ground to the left of the road, he saw
that McNeely was headed for danger. The 3/5 commander radioed Bohn
to stop the jeep, but it was too late. McNeely and his men vanished from
sight around the bend where the road skirted the large hill, and the
Marines heard a furious clatter of machinegun and small arms fire.</p>

<p>The fate of the patrol remained in doubt as Company G moved out to
the attack, with First Lieutenant Jack Westerman’s platoon in the lead.
Communist fire held up the advance, but Bohn sent Second Lieutenant
Edward F. Duncan’s platoon on a sweeping envelopment to the right
which outflanked the enemy and drove him from the high ground.
Westerman was then able to reach the crest with his platoon. From this
position he could see McNeely’s bullet-riddled jeep, but that officer and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
his five men were stretched out motionless on the ground beneath and
behind the vehicle.</p>

<p>At great risk, Westerman made a dash to the jeep and brought back
McNeely, mortally wounded. Enemy fire prevented further rescues, but
it was ascertained that 3 men had been killed outright and 2 severely
wounded. These survivors could only continue to take cover behind the
wrecked vehicle until 3/5 troops advanced.</p>

<p>When Company G jumped off again, the men were held up by two
concealed machineguns at the far end of the road bend. Taplett committed
How Company on the left side of the MSR, and Fegan seized the
hill opposite Bohn’s position. It was almost dark before the Marines
could silence the 2 enemy machineguns around the bend, and at 2015
Murray ordered 3/5 to secure for the night and defend the 2 hills already
occupied. On the premise that the enemy had prepared an ambush for
rescue parties approaching the wrecked jeep, it was decided to wait until
morning to bring back the wounded men.</p>

<h3><i>The Seizure of Kosong</i></h3>

<p>The night passed quietly except for scattered rifle fire along the 3d
Battalion’s 700-yard front. To carry out General Craig’s orders for 11
August, the two rifle companies prepared to continue the attack on
Kosong at first light.<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_258" href="#FNanchor_258" class="fnanchor">258</a> This section is derived from: Annex How; Craig, 12 Jan 54; Fegan and Bohn, 17 Apr
54 (with comments by LtCol R. D. Taplett).</p></div>

<p>The enemy had different plans. At the crack of dawn a small force
of North Koreans emerged from the fog and charged recklessly into
Company G’s front. There was a furious hand-to-hand clash as the
attackers converged on Bohn’s OP in the center of the line. The company
commander directed the defense amid grenade explosions, one of
which drove a fragment into his shoulder. At his side Staff Sergeant
Charles F. Kurtz, Jr., called down effective 60-mm. mortar fire on the
Reds while throwing grenades and ducking submachinegun bursts.</p>

<p>The melee ended after a half hour with Company G driving the
battered remnants of the NKPA platoon back down the hill Despite his
wound, Bohn stayed with his company and reorganized it for the attack
on Kosong. He also had the satisfaction of overseeing the evacuation of
the two wounded survivors of McNeely’s ill-fated patrol.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
At 0800, the Brigade moved out in a route column, with 3/5 as the
advance guard and Company G in the role of advance party. Bohn’s
point consisted of Second Lieutenant John D. Counselman’s 3d Platoon,
whose leading element, under Corporal Raymond Giaquinto, was on the
MSR with flank guards slightly withheld on each side.</p>

<p>The Brigade column moved swiftly. About a mile beyond the line of
departure, Giaquinto braked his roadbound unit in the face of doubtful
ground ahead. Simultaneously, the flank guards surged forward and
wrapped around the suspected area. Then Giaquinto’s force raced down
the road, and the 3 prongs of the point converged on an enemy machinegun
emplacement, killing the 5 occupants before they could fire a shot.</p>

<p>With Bohn calling the shots and Giaquinto setting the pace, the point
swept aside three more enemy positions along the route. The effective
combination of limited frontal attacks and envelopments brought the
head of the column to the bridge north of Kosong at 1000. Here Company
H passed through on the road and pushed into the town.</p>

<p>Using 1 rifle platoon and 2 tanks, Fegan easily cleared northern
Kosong of light resistance. Then he gradually wheeled his force to the
right, tracing the road to Sachon. His other two platoons continued
southward with the mission of seizing a high hill below Sunam-dong.</p>

<p>General Craig reached Kosong by jeep just as Taplett was setting up
his CP in a schoolyard north of the town. A small group of enemy
snipers suddenly opened up from positions in and around the schoolhouse,
and the Brigade commander observed sniper teams of 3/5’s headquarters
spring into action and destroy the North Koreans.</p>

<p>Shortly after Fegan entered Kosong, Bohn swung his company to the
southwest from above the town, drove through the western suburbs and
launched an attack against Hill 88 below the Sachon road. Approaching
the hill, Company G sustained a few casualties while eliminating a stubborn
Communist pocket in the low ground on its right flank.</p>

<p>MAG-33 preceded the attack on Hill 88 with a thundering air strike
on 100 enemy entrenched along the crest. This attack coupled with a
thorough shelling by 1/11, shattered the Reds’ will to fight, and Company
G found only evidence of a hasty flight when it reached the summit
at 1330.</p>

<p>General Craig ordered Taplett to cancel all further missions around
the captured town and attack toward Sachon immediately. Company G
was quickly recalled from Hill 88; the high ground above Sunam-dong
was ignored, and Fegan assembled his unit at the western edge of
Kosong preparatory to leading the attack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
Just as Company H was reforming, a jeep ambulance driven by Corpsman
William H. Anderson raced into the area to pick up casualties from
Bohn’s earlier skirmish below Hill 88. Passing through Fegan’s troops,
the vehicle failed to make the turn southward and sped toward Sachon.
Two enemy antitank guns lying in wait west of Kosong blasted the jeep
as it rounded a bend, killing Anderson and spilling two passengers out
of the wrecked vehicle.</p>

<p>Fegan led two M-26 tanks to the bend, and Technical Sergeant
Johnnie C. Cottrell quickly destroyed the North Korean position. Three
rounds from his 90-mm. gun wiped out the last NKPA opposition in the
area, and the 3d Battalion moved out for the drive on Sachon.</p>

<p class="chapsmy"><i>The Kosong Turkey Shoot—The Changchon Ambush—Marines
Ordered to New Sector—Attack of 3/5 to the Rear—Enemy Dawn
Attack at Changchon—Breaking Off Action</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">Marine air and</span> artillery had a field day on 11 August 1950 that
the rifle companies will never forget. The occasion was known
as “the Kosong Turkey Shoot,” and it was a victory won entirely by
supporting arms.</p>

<p>It happened just as 3/5 was about to enter Kosong. As a preliminary,
1/11 was called upon just before noon for preparatory fires. Shells from
the 105’s landed in the town, sending up geysers of rubble in the bright
sunlight. Then, suddenly, the Marine artillery flushed out a column of
enemy vehicles making a frantic dash for safety.</p>

<p>This flight explains the light resistance which the Marine infantry met
in Kosong. But the enemy could hardly have chosen a less propitious
moment, for he had merely escaped from the frying pan into the fire.
Overhead, to his sorrow, was a division of VMF-323 planes from the
<i>Badoeng Strait</i>, which the forward TACP had sent on a search and attack
mission just beyond the town.<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a> Major Lund and his pilots were thus
presented with a fabulous target of opportunity—an estimated 100
vehicles of the NKPA 83d Motorcycle Regiment, including jeeps,
motorcycles and troop-carrying trucks.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_259" href="#FNanchor_259" class="fnanchor">259</a> VMF-323 SAR, 3 Aug-6 Sep 50.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_260" href="#FNanchor_260" class="fnanchor">260</a> Estimates as to the number of vehicles vary widely. Apparently no exact count was ever
made.</p></div>

<h3><i>The Kosong Turkey Shoot</i></h3>

<p>The Corsairs came screaming down in low-level strafing runs the entire
length of the column for the purpose of bringing it to a halt. Vehicles<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
crashed into one another or piled up in the ditch while enemy troops
scrambled out for cover. The Soviet-made jeeps and motorcycles were
now sitting ducks for F4U’s which worked over individual targets with
rocket or 20-mm. fire. After the Marine planes had set about 40 vehicles
on fire, they were relieved by another flight of VMF-323 machines and
Air Force F-51’s which added the finishing touches to the picture of
destruction.<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_261" href="#FNanchor_261" class="fnanchor">261</a> Ernest Giusti, “Marine Air Over the Pusan Perimeter,” <cite>Marine Corps Gazette</cite>, 36, No.
5:20–21 (May 52).</p></div>

<p>Under the circumstances the enemy put up a creditable fight. Lund
and his low-flying pilots encountered fierce small arms and automatic
weapons fire. Two of the four Corsairs in the first flight were badly
damaged and had to try for emergency landings. Lieutenant Doyle Cole
ditched into the bay just as General Craig was making a tour of inspection
by helicopter; and the Brigade commander operated the hoist which
pulled the dripping flier up to safety.</p>

<p>Captain Vivian Moses was not so fortunate. While putting his
crippled plane down in enemy territory, he was thrown unconscious
from the cockpit and drowned in a rice paddy a few minutes before a
VMO-6 helicopter arrived. Only the day before, this gallant Marine
pilot had been rescued by helicopter, after being shot down behind the
NKPA lines, and flown back unhurt to his carrier. Despite this experience,
Captain Moses volunteered for duty on 11 August, when he
became the first death casualty of MAG-33.</p>

<p>Several hours later, after securing Kosong and resuming the attack
toward Sachon, the Marine ground forces caught up with the scene of
chaos left by the F4U’s. Among the twisted and charred vehicles were
some that the enemy had abandoned in perfect condition. Tolerant
NCO’s relaxed discipline for a moment while their men tried out the
motorcycles with sidecars and the sleek, black Soviet jeeps, most of
which had gone into the attack practically new. Almost identical in
design to American jeeps, these vehicles were found to be powered by
familiar Ford-type engines—a throwback to United States Lend Lease to
Russia in World War II.</p>

<p>Generals Craig and Cushman surveyed the wreckage from a helicopter
next day. This strike, however, was only one of the more dramatic examples
of the Brigade air-ground team in action. MAG-33 aircraft were
constantly orbiting on station over the front line as the ground forces
advanced. Flown by infantry-trained pilots briefed on the local ground<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
situation, the Corsairs were available for employment on short notice.
It was a simple and flexible system; and the fact that VMF-214 and
VMF-323 were based on the two carriers meant that they could arrive on
station with more fuel and ordnance for strikes as compared to Japan-based
squadrons.<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_262" href="#FNanchor_262" class="fnanchor">262</a> This summary of tactical air operations is derived from MCBS, I-IV-B, 9–14; Maj
George J. King, interv with author, n. d.</p></div>

<p>Overall control of tactical air operations in Korea was exercised by
the Fifth Air Force. Marine aviation units, as components of an integrated
Fleet Marine Force, operated in support of the Brigade as their
highest priority, and in support of other UN forces as a lower priority.
After checking in with Fifth AF TACC at the Joint Operations Center
(JOC), Marine aviation units came under Marine operational control
when supporting Brigade ground forces. When providing tactical air
support for other UN forces, Marine air units operated under the Air
Force-Army system for tactical air support.</p>

<p>The Brigade control organization included 3 battalion TACP’s and 1
regimental TACP, each consisting of an officer and 6 enlisted men, and
each equipped with a radio jeep, portable radios and remoting equipment.
MAG-33 provided a Brigade control agency consisting of the Air
Support Section of MTACS-2. Other Brigade units associated with
control of aircraft were:</p>

<p>(1) The Air Section of the Brigade Staff, consisting of the Brigade Air
officer and six enlisted men responsible for planning as well as tactical
control and coordination of supporting aircraft;</p>

<p>(2) The Brigade observation section, consisting of the tactical air
observer, three gunnery observers, and the OY and rotary-wing aircraft
of VMO-6.</p>

<p>Carrier-based Marine aviation units maintained a TAC and one or
more flights of aircraft on station during daylight hours. Night heckler
and intruder missions of VMF(N)-513 from Itazuke reported to the
Fifth AF TACC and were routed by that agency to the Air Support Section
(MTACS-2) with the Brigade. During the early Brigade operations,
with the Air Force TACC located at Taegu, delays of incoming flights
reporting to JOC were caused by overloaded communications nets. An
improvement resulted when such flights by-passed JOC and reported
directly to the Air Support Section of Brigade. And when JOC moved
back to Pusan, improved communications resulted in incoming flights
reporting first to JOC again.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
The Brigade control agency (Air Support Section) made use of the
following communications for the control of tactical air operations:</p>

<p>(1) TAR net connecting battalion TACP’s, the regimental TACP, and
the Air Support Section, and monitored by the Brigade Air Section.
This was an HF net.</p>

<p>(2) TAD net connecting above-named agencies as well as TAC flights
of support aircraft and on occasion the TAO. This was a VHF net of
four frequencies used to brief and control aircraft reporting for support
missions.</p>

<p>(3) TAO net connecting observation aircraft, the Brigade CP (Air
Section) and the Air Support Section. This was an HF net.</p>

<p>(4) An administrative (HF) net connecting the Air Support Section
and the carriers <i>Sicily</i> and <i>Badoeng Strait</i>.</p>

<p>The workings of the control organization of the Brigade air-ground
team in the Pusan Perimeter have been described as follows in the survey
of the Marine Corps Board Study:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Battalion TACP’s made requests for air support missions direct by TAR net to
the Air Support Section. The regimental TACP and Brigade Air Section monitored
this net. The Brigade control agency having received a request for a mission, contacted
the TAC and the Flight Leader (FL) of the aircraft orbiting on station awaiting
a mission. The TAC and the FL were then directed to the vicinity of the TACP
from whom the request had originated.</p>

<p>“The TACP controlled the execution of the mission in accordance with the wishes
of the battalion commander. The TACP gave the location of the target to the TAC.
The latter designated the target to the FL and his flight of supporting aircraft. The
unit being supported marked its front lines. The TAC directed the attacking aircraft
in making attacks on the target. His directions related to the technique of attacking
specific targets with aircraft. Control of the attack was exercised by the ground unit
being supported.</p>

<p>“In many instances the TAC or the TAO would locate targets not yet located by
ground units. This was often done in response to a request from ground units. Both
the TAC and TAO located targets beyond the vision of ground units, and both were
capable of, and did, designate these targets to flights of supporting aircraft and
directed attacks on such targets, when requested to do so by ground units. Conditions
favored delegating control to forward TACP’s beyond convenient VHF range
between them and the Brigade (Air Support Section). Brigade attack formations frequently
consisted of battalions in column. The forward battalion was free to employ
air support at a moment’s notice.”</p></blockquote>

<p>This was the situation on the afternoon of 11 August 1950 as the 3d
Battalion of the 5th Marines attacked toward Sachon, followed by 2/5
in trace. Overhead a flight of VMF-323 Corsairs orbited on station, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
OY observers reported the enemy to be pulling back rapidly toward
Sachon.</p>

<p>How Company led the Marine attack, with lead tanks employing
reconnaissance by fire. At 1800, after the column had covered several
miles, a lone enemy machinegun in a valley on the left held up the advance
by wounding three Marines. By the time the tanks silenced the
weapon with .50-caliber fire, it was decided to halt. Taplett deployed his
battalion on two hills north of the road, and the infantrymen settled
down for a quiet night.</p>

<p>The gravel crunchers could thank air and other supporting arms for
an impressive demonstration of power that day. There was even the suggestion
of an amphibious operation in the Brigade advance, for an LST
followed the column and anchored near the fishing village of Tanghong-ni
after the securing of Kosong.</p>

<p>This was LST QO119, a supply ship manned by Team No. 1 of Major
William L. Batchelor’s Company A, 1st Shore Party Battalion. Team
No. 2 set up forward dumps along the MSR as the infantry advanced,
while No. 3 unloaded supplies and equipment at the Masan railhead.
Shore Party personnel also assisted in salvage operations, which were
conducted mainly at Changwon.<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_263" href="#FNanchor_263" class="fnanchor">263</a> Annex Mike to Brig SAR.</p></div>

<p>LST QO119 was not only the workhorse of normal Shore Party missions;
it served also as an improvised hospital ship. For the Medical Section
and Company C, 1st Medical Battalion, had an extra responsibility
these sweltering days in caring for victims of heat prostration as well as
the wounded. Thus it may have set some sort of a record when casualties
were evacuated at one time by land, sea and air—motor ambulance, LST
and helicopter.</p>

<h3><i>The Changchon Ambush</i></h3>

<p>At sundown on 11 August, as Taplett’s battalion dug in for the night on
the road to Sachon, the enemy seemed to be disorganized if not actually
demoralized. For the first time since the invasion began, a sustained
Eighth Army counterattack had not only stopped the Red Korean
steamroller but sent it into reverse.</p>

<p>With the Marines a day’s march from Sachon, the Army 5th RCT was
running a dead heat on the shorter Chinju route to the north, where<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
opposition had been light the last 2 days. It might even have appeared
on the evening of the 11th that the combined operation had turned into
a friendly rivalry between two outfits racing toward their final objective
by parallel roads. But any such assumption would have been premature,
as General Craig and his staff well realized. They looked for further resistance
and were not disillusioned. Within the next 48 hours, in fact,
Craig’s men were destined to carry out one of the most astonishing operations
in the history of the Marine Corps—simultaneous BLT attacks in
opposite directions on two fronts 25 miles apart.</p>

<p>There was no hint of any such development at 0630 on the morning
of 12 August, when the 1st Battalion of the 5th Marines passed through
the 3d Battalion with a mission of seizing Sachon. If anything, the front
was too quiet to suit veteran NCO’s, who suspected the enemy of being
up to no good. The column moved out behind a 15-man detachment of
Recon Company acting as the point under the command of Captain
Kenneth J. Houghton. Next came Baker Company with the 1st, 2d, and
3d Platoons in that order. Two Marine tanks were sandwiched in between
the 1st and 2d Platoons, and three more M-26’s brought up the
rear of Captain Tobin’s company, followed by the main body of the
battalion.</p>

<p>No opposition awaited the column. This unnatural calm continued
for 4½ hours as the Marines advanced about 11 miles. At noon, with
Sachon only 4 miles away, Houghton and the point rounded a bend into
the thatched-hut hamlet of Changchon. The first enemy soldiers of the
day were sighted when two skulking figures took cover. Several Marines
opened fire, and in reply the hills on both sides of the road erupted into
flame.<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_264" href="#FNanchor_264" class="fnanchor">264</a> This section is derived from: Brig SAR, 5th Marines, 1st Bn rpt; Maj John L. Tobin,

and T/Sgt F. J. Lischeski, ltr to author, 14 Jan 54.</p></div>

<p>The enemy had obviously planned to allow the entire column to come
within range. But the trap was sprung prematurely as NKPA machineguns
blazed away from the high ground in front and on both flanks.
Captain Tobin immediately sent the 1st Platoon to the aid of the point.
First Lieutenant Hugh C. Schryver led his men forward along the roadside
ditches, and at the cost of three casualties they reinforced the thin
line of Recon troops returning the enemy’s fire.</p>

<p>Next, the company commander ordered First Lieutenant David S.
Taylor’s 2d Platoon to move up behind three Marine tanks. The M-26’s
were unable to maneuver off the road because of the danger of bogging<span class="pagenum"><a class="hidep" id="Page_145">145</a><a id="Page_146">146</a></span>
down in rice paddies, but as mobile fortresses they added to Marine fire
power.</p>

<p>Tobin’s whole company became more or less pinned down when the
3d Platoon and headquarters, farther back on the road, received automatic
weapons fire from Hill 250 on the right. Newton immediately
requested the battalion air controller, First Lieutenant James W. Smith,
to call for a strike in this area. This was the only supporting arm available
at the moment, since the mortar and artillery crews were just setting
up their weapons in hastily selected positions.</p>

<p>After the Corsairs worked over Hill 250, Tobin ordered Second Lieutenant
David R. Cowling’s 3d Platoon to attack the high ground. A
rifle platoon and machinegun section had been sent forward from Able
Company by the battalion commander, and Newton gave these
reinforcements the mission of seizing Hill 301, also on the right side
of the road.</p>

<p>As Cowling’s men were crossing the open rice paddy, the Marine tank
guns and mortars added their fires to the air strike. But enough enemy
machineguns survived to catch the 3d Platoon in a crossfire which forced
it to fall back with 1 man killed and 4 wounded. The Able Company
contingent occupied Hill 301 meanwhile without meeting any resistance.</p>

<p>During the course of these actions, the FAC reported to Newton that
2 of the Corsairs overhead had 5 minutes of time left. The battalion
commander directed that they search for targets of opportunity along
the road leading from Changchon to Sachon. The result was a repetition
on a small scale of the Kosong turkey shoot, for the Marine planes surprised
a little column of enemy vehicles and personnel. After the Corsairs
unloaded their remaining ordnance, the road was strewn with
twisted and burning vehicles.</p>

<p>The 3d Platoon fell back on Hill 301 as Newton ordered Captain
John R. Stevens to secure the nearby high ground on the right side of the
road with the rest of his Able Company troops. This left Hill 250 as the
center of enemy resistance on the right. A total of 113 Marine mortar
rounds were delivered on these positions, followed by a second air strike.
The concentration of fire finally silenced the enemy’s remaining machineguns,
and the Baker Company right flank was secured.</p>

<p>The other two Baker Company platoons and Houghton’s men had
their hands full meanwhile on the left flank. They kept up a brisk fire
fight from the roadside ditches until the Marine artillery took charge of
the situation. One enemy position after another was knocked out in this
quarter as Newton called for three more air strikes. These preparatory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
fires enabled the 1st and 2d Platoons to attack on the left after a laborious
crossing of an intervening rice paddy.</p>

<p>The Marines proceeded to clean up the remaining NKPA positions
methodically. A climax was reached when Lieutenant Taylor spotted an
enemy group approaching the crest of Hill 202 from the reverse slope.
He sent Technical Sergeant F. J. Lischeski with a squad to prepare a
welcome. The veteran NCO coolly formed a line along the ridge and
directed his men to wait until the enemy came within 75 feet before
opening fire.</p>

<p>It would be hard to find a more striking example of Marine infantry
firepower. Of the 39 men in the NKPA group, all were killed outright
in a matter of seconds except a single officer. This survivor was so badly
wounded that he died on the way to the regimental CP.</p>

<p>The fight had lasted all afternoon, and darkness fell before Company
B could complete its movement to the high ground on the left side of
the road and set up a perimeter of defense. It was estimated that an
enemy company was operating in the area, covering the retreat of sorely
battered elements of the NKPA 6th Infantry Division and 83d Motorcycle
Regiment.</p>

<p>Marine losses were 3 killed and 13 wounded. After the securing of the
high ground to the right, casualties were evacuated by road on the lee
side of slowly moving tanks which provided shelter from enemy fire on
the left.</p>

<h3><i>Marines Ordered to New Sector</i></h3>

<p>The Marines of 1/5 anticipated that the next day’s advance would take
them to Sachon. At midnight on 12 August, however, Lieutenant Colonel
Newton received orders from the regimental commander to form the
battalion on the road at 0630 in preparation for a lift by trucks to another
sector, where the Marines were to reinforce Army units.</p>

<p>While Newton’s men were fighting at Changchon, the Brigade commander
had come up against a most unusual command situation. It
began late on the morning of the 12th, when General Craig received
orders from CG Task Force Kean, directing him to move a reinforced
Marine rifle battalion back to Chindong-ni. General Kean emphasized
that the shift be made without delay. Infiltrating enemy forces had penetrated
far back in the rear to overrun positions of Battery C, 555th
(“Triple Nickel”) Field Artillery Battalion and Headquarters and Able
Batteries, 90th Field Artillery Battalion, supporting the 25th Division.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
The MSR being endangered, Marine reinforcements were urgently
needed for a counterattack.<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_265" href="#FNanchor_265" class="fnanchor">265</a> This section is derived from: Craig, 18 May 5 and 12 Jan 54; Murray, 14 Jan 54; and
Brig SAR, 5th Marines, 1st Bn and 3d Bn rpts.</p></div>

<p>At 0800 that morning Craig had set up his CP at Kosong. It was his
custom to keep a terse and factual record of events from day to day, and
the following chronological account is derived from entries in the
Brigade commander’s field notebook:</p>

<blockquote class="itemlist">

<p>“1130—Received telephonic orders from CG 25th Div, stating that enemy was attacking
in force across our MSR near Chindong-ni. He directed that I send
one reinforced battalion to rear at once to give assistance to 24th Infantry engaged
in that area and to recapture artillery pieces.</p>

<p>“1200—Proceeded by helicopter to CP 5th Marines to give necessary instructions.
Made two landings en route to gather trucks for troop lift.</p>

<p>“1300—The reinforced 3d Bn., 5th Marines, now on way to Chindong-ni area.</p>

<p>“1330—Sent my G-3, LtCol Stewart, and LtCol Taplett, CO of 3/5, by helicopter to
bridge indicated by CG 25th Div. to reconnoiter and formulate plans prior to
arrival of battalion. Marines to operate directly under 25th Division for this
action.</p>

<p>“1400—We are out on a limb with only two battalions left and Sachon still to take.
Went to leading elements to check. They were engaged in a heavy fire fight
at an attempted ambush position. Air brought to bear and helped, plus artillery.
Enemy positions taken by 1/5, which dug in on high ground while 2/5
was disposed to protect rest of Brigade column.</p>

<p>“1730—Returned to Brigade CP at Kosong and received orders to proceed via helicopter
to Masan to confer with CG 25th Division.</p>

<p>“1815—On flight to Masan I detoured to Chindong-ni area to make sure by air observation
that 3/5 had arrived and apparently was not having any trouble.</p>

<p>“1830—Arrived Masan and was directed by General Kean to commence a tactical
withdrawal from Sachon.</p>

<p>“1945—Returned by helicopter to my Kosong CP in early darkness and issued
necessary orders.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The preparations for withdrawal lowered the spirits of Marines who
believed that they had broken the back of enemy resistance in the Sachon
area. This reaction may even be noted in the first paragraph of the
Brigade withdrawal order:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“1. <span class="smcap">General Situation.</span> Following Brigade rapid advance from Chindong-ni to
Sachon in which this Brigade attacked, overcame, and pursued the enemy, the 25th
Infantry Division has directed the withdrawal of this Brigade in order to hold a defensive
position and mop up enemy resistance in the zone of action of elements of
the 25th Division.”</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
It would later be known that the basic reason for the Brigade withdrawal
was a decision by the Eighth Army command and staff. The
enemy had crossed the river Naktong, the last natural barrier of the
Pusan Perimeter, and this emergency had caused the Marines to be
pulled back in readiness for a counterattack in the Naktong bulge.</p>

<h3><i>Attack of 3/5 to the Rear</i></h3>

<p>The foregoing chronology makes it evident that General Craig could
never have handled this situation in an afternoon without helicopter
transportation. Jeeps could not have reached so many destinations over
narrow, twisting roads choked with traffic; and fixed-wing planes, even
the adaptable OY’s, could not have landed wherever the Brigade commander
willed. Marine helicopters set a good many precedents in Korea,
and the events of 12 August 1950 established the usefulness of these
versatile machines for command and staff flights.</p>

<p>Early that afternoon, as Craig had directed, Stewart and Taplett flew
back to the Chindong-ni area for reconnaissance and planning prior to
the arrival of 3/5. The Brigade commander had been able to give them
very little initial information. About 2,000 to 2,500 enemy had infiltrated
to the vicinity, according to Army estimates. The two Marine officers
were instructed to fly to a bridge over a dry stream bed, where they
would be met and briefed by a 25th Division liaison officer awaiting
them in a jeep with a red air panel on the hood.<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_266" href="#FNanchor_266" class="fnanchor">266</a> This section is derived from LtCol Robert D. Taplett’s detailed statement to Marine
Corps Evaluation Board, n. d.</p></div>

<p>Stewart and Taplett found the bridge, though no jeep was in sight.
After landing in the stream bed, they discovered a camouflaged Army
light tank; but the officers of the armored company could not offer any
enlightenment.</p>

<p>A number of wire lines lay in the roadside ditch, and the Marine officers
checked them, one by one. At length, by a process of trial and error,
they found a line leading to the 25th Division CP and talked to the G-3.
He instructed them to “look the situation over” and decide upon a
course of action to eliminate enemy activity in the area and provide
security for the remaining artillery unit—a battery of the 159th Field
Artillery Battalion which had been attached to the 555th. Then the
Marine officers were to report to General Barth, ADC of the 25th Division,
upon his arrival in the area to take the overall command.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
Ever since the jump-off of 7 August, the operations of Task Force
Kean had been distinguished for informality. Oral orders were the rule
rather than exception, with unusual latitude of decision being permitted
to officers in the field. After their telephone conversation, Stewart and
Taplett made a helicopter reconnaissance of the area, followed by a flight
back over the MSR to locate 3/5. Upon their return, they encountered
Colonel John Daly, USA, CO of the 555th Field Artillery Battalion.
Battery C of that unit, he informed them, had been surprised the night
before, along with two batteries of the 90th, and completely overrun
about 3,000 yards up the stream bed. They were destroyed as a fighting
force, though scattered survivors and wounded men remained in the
area. Daly briefed the Marine officers as to the location of enemy forces;
and they decided to seize two key ridges commanding the MSR, which
ran parallel to the stream bed. The troops of 3/5 were just then piling
out of the trucks at the debarkation point, and Taplett ordered them to
attack without waiting for Barth, since it would soon be dark.</p>

<p>These Marines, contrary to standing operating procedure, had turned
their backs on the roar of battle at Changchon early that afternoon and
ridden away in the opposite direction. Then, to complete the mystery,
they traveled 25 miles to the rear to assault a ridge which was supposedly
secured. How Company jumped off with George following in trace.
Colonel Daly provided a 15-minute artillery preparation, though he had
no orders, and Taplett’s FAC managed to summon a flight of Corsairs
with partial loads aboard, including napalm. No one had any idea of the
enemy’s strength, and after receiving some fire from the ridge, Captain
Fegan picked the locations for an air strike. How Company moved in
rapidly afterwards against such light resistance that the Marines seized
the first position without a single casualty. Only one casualty was inflicted
upon the enemy, who apparently had put up a rearguard fight
while withdrawing.</p>

<p>At 1900, when General Barth arrived, he asked when the Marine battalion
would be ready to attack. Taplett replied that he already had one
company on the first objective, and the 25th Division ADC congratulated
the Marines on their promptness. He approved Taplett’s course of
action and gave his sanction for the seizure of the rest of the dominating
high ground the following morning.</p>

<p>Again the Marines received the most cordial cooperation from the
Army. General Barth ordered several light tanks and three M-44 armored
personnel carriers to support the attack at 0700 on 13 August.
The same Army artillery battery was assigned to the operation, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
Battery C of the 11th Marines took part after arriving the night before.
As it proved, the infantry needed little assistance to seize the remaining
objectives against negligible resistance. By 1000 the Marine rifle companies
were in full possession of the two commanding ridgelines. No
casualties were suffered or inflicted.</p>

<p>Despite the lack of opposition, the enemy had not pulled out of the
area. When Lieutenant Colonel Murray made a helicopter flight to drop
a message to survivors of the 555th, his helicopter was ambushed in a
defile by NKPA marksmen concealed on both sides. Only the pilot’s
skillful maneuvering got them out safely, and they were unable to complete
their mission.</p>

<p>A plan for the Marines to advance to the west across the valley floor
while the Army 5th RCT attacked rearward to meet them was considered
by the 25th Division. Taplett’s battalion would have been accompanied
by 2/5, then on the way to the Chindong-ni area. But this scheme
of maneuver was canceled, and the 2d Battalion of the 5th RCT relieved
3/5 on 14 August. By that time, as will be related later, other elements
of the Brigade were on the way to an assembly area at Miryang in preparation
for an operation in another sector.</p>

<p>At least the attack by 3/5 enabled elements of the 25th Division to
rescue survivors of the artillery batteries who straggled back. Both Taplett
and Stewart believed that enemy numbers in the area had been much
smaller than the original Army estimate of 2,000 to 2,500 men. The 3/5
commander wanted to complete his mission by attacking to recover the
howitzers and other lost equipment while the opportunity still existed.
But he was unable to accomplish this aim because of orders for Brigade
withdrawal, and the artillery pieces were never recaptured. Air strikes
were called to destroy them after the relief of the Marine battalion, and
the area itself was abandoned a few days later when 25th Division units
fell back before renewed NKPA attacks.</p>

<h3><i>Enemy Dawn Attack at Changchon</i></h3>

<p>On the other Marine front, 25 miles distant, 1/5 had a return engagement
before dawn on 13 August with the enemy in the Changchon area.
Company commanders had received orders the night before to alert their
units at 0400 for the withdrawal. General Craig’s Op Order 10-50 was a
complete and well planned field order, despite the need for haste; but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
enemy interrupted with a surprise attack launched from concealed
positions occupied under cover of darkness.<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_267" href="#FNanchor_267" class="fnanchor">267</a> Craig, 12 Jan 54.</p></div>

<p>Baker Company’s defense setup for the night on Hill 202 consisted of
the 3d, 1st, and 2d Platoons tied in from left to right in that order. The
action began at 0450 with enemy automatic weapons fire. Marine 60-mm.
mortar illuminating shells revealed an NKPA infiltration on the right in
the area of the 2d Platoon.</p>

<p>This effort soon proved to be a diversionary attack for the purpose of
masking the main blow. At 0455 3 enemy flares went up, 2 red and 1
green. They were the signal for an assault on the left flank at the other
end of the Baker Company position. The enemy, as a wounded Marine
NCO put it afterwards, was “right on top of the 3d Platoon in a few
seconds” with grenades and burp guns.<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_268" href="#FNanchor_268" class="fnanchor">268</a> Tobin, of 26 Apr 54.</p></div>

<p>This was one of the occasions when the Marines were painfully
reminded that the NKPA 6th Division had been made up originally of
veterans of the Chinese civil war, conditioned by experience for the rigors
of night fighting. Marine security had not been at fault, yet the enemy
had managed to creep forward in uncanny silence to positions within
grenade-throwing distance.</p>

<p>In an instant the Marine position was overrun, with the machinegun
section being wiped out except for two men. Communication troubles
added to the confusion. Platoon radios had been rendered inoperative by
mud and water while crossing rice paddies, and telephone wires were
believed to have been cut. Two runners were killed during Tobin’s
efforts to maintain contact with the hard-pressed troops on the left
flank. A third runner got through with orders for the remnants of the
platoon to fall back within the perimeter of the adjacent 1st Platoon.</p>

<p>The troubles of Baker Company were compounded at this stage when
the enemy turned two of the Marines’ own machineguns against them.</p>

<p>During the next hour the fight became a slugging match. When the
first gray light of dawn permitted some visibility, Baker Company 3.5″
rocket launchers knocked out the two Marine machineguns being fired
by the enemy. The left flank was holding well when the 60-mm. mortars
ran out of ammunition. To make matters worse, the artillery FO’s radio
took destructive hits from machinegun fire just as the enemy changed
the direction of his attack. Now his main effort was being channeled up
the draw between the 1st and 2d Platoons for the obvious purpose of<span class="pagenum"><a class="hidep" id="Page_154">154</a><a id="Page_155">155</a></span>
splitting the company and beating it in detail. The attackers had been
bled white by casualties, however, and Tobin’s men had little difficulty
in beating off the new assault.</p>

  NIGHT OF 12–13 AUG. 1950</p></div></div>

<h3><i>Breaking Off Action</i></h3>

<p>Battalion orders were received through Able Company to disengage at
0630 and pull down from the high ground to the trucking point at Newton’s
CP. Tobin was now depending on Company A radios for 4.2″ and
81-mm. mortar support which slowed up enemy efforts. As his first
move toward breaking off action, he ordered his 3d and 1st Platoons to
withdraw into the perimeter of the 2d.<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_269" href="#FNanchor_269" class="fnanchor">269</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>By this time the enemy had fallen back toward the lower levels of Hill
202. Small arms fire had slackened but the Marines still received mortar
bursts.</p>

<p>Tobin ordered his executive officer, Captain Francis I. Fenton, to take
the wounded across the rice paddies to the road with the 3d Platoon and
Headquarters troops. The company commander remained on the hill to
cover this movement with the other two platoons. After Fenton got well
underway, Tobin ordered the 2d Platoon down to the road. Then, a
squad at a time, the remaining Marines disengaged; and the Baker Company
commander came off Hill 202 with the last squad at 0815. The entire
movement had been accomplished with precision, and a final air
strike kept the enemy quiet at the climax.</p>

<p>Considering the fury of the fighting on Hill 202, a Marine casualty list
of 12 KIA, 18 WIA, and 8 MIA was not as large as might have been
expected. The idea of men missing in action is always disturbing to Marine
officers, but it was considered a moral certainty that the eight casualties
of this type were killed when the enemy overran the machinegun
section on the Baker Company left flank.<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a> Before leaving Hill 202, Captain
Tobin asked permission to lead an attack for the purpose of recovering
the bodies. He believed that he could retake the lost ground in an
hour, but his request could not be granted at a time when the battalion
was belated in carrying out Brigade withdrawal orders.<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_270" href="#FNanchor_270" class="fnanchor">270</a> Seven of these casualties were transferred from the MIA to the KIA column in September
1950 after the recovery of their bodies, following enemy withdrawal from the area.
The eighth continued to be listed as MIA until November 1953, when the man was
assumed to be dead.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_271" href="#FNanchor_271" class="fnanchor">271</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>It fell to the engineers and armor to cover the rear after the infantry
pulled out. Midway between Sachon and Kosong, the MSR is joined by
a road from Samchonpo, a minor seaport on the tip of the peninsula. In
order to block this approach to the Brigade’s southern flank, General
Craig ordered the engineers to mine the road. First Lieutenant Nicholas
A. Canzona was assigned to the task with a detachment of his 1st Platoon
of Able Company, 1st Engineer Battalion. After laying an extensive
field, this officer discovered to his embarrassment that he had erred in
arming nearly half of the mines with wrong fuses, so that they were
harmless. Apparently the moral effect was enough, however, to keep the
enemy at a distance.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Hetrick’s 3d Platoon of the engineer company brought up
the Brigade rear on the morning of 13 August to crater roads, lay antitank
minefields and destroy bridges and culverts. Personnel left behind
for such missions had the privilege of riding the rearmost tank to catch
up with the column.<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a> Thus the withdrawal proceeded systematically
and was completed without enemy interference.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The movement of</span> the Brigade to Miryang was completed by rail,
LST and shuttling trucks on 15 August. For the infantry, it meant
the first hot meal in Korea, and the bivouac area seemed a cool, green
paradise as compared to the sun-scorched hills the men had been climbing
under fire this past week. A grove of stately trees provided shade;
and thanks to the frugality of peasants who picked up every twig, the
grass and moss were like a well-swept carpet. There the troops of the
Brigade slept under the stars that night and swam in the nearby Miryang
river. It was a veritable reunion for Leathernecks who swapped tales of
experiences in the recent combats.</p>

<p>Being Marines, they realized of course that this was merely an interlude
between operations. The Brigade had passed under operational
control of the 24th Infantry Division upon arrival in the Miryang area.
And on the 15th General Craig reported to General Church’s CP to be
briefed on the situation in the Naktong Bulge, where the next assault
would be launched.</p>

<p>The ability of the Russians to cross the widest rivers in World War II,
using only determination and field expedients, constantly amazed <i>Wehrmacht</i>
generals with much better equipment.<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a> This know-how seemed to
have been passed on to the NKPA, judging by the crossings of the Han
and Kum Rivers early in the Korean conflict. On 6 August 1950, the
Red Koreans gave a repeat performance when they forced a 1,000-man
bridgehead across the Naktong river, thus breaching the last natural
barrier protecting the lifeline from Pusan to Taegu.</p>

<p>The 24th Infantry Division was unsuccessful in its immediate
attempts to dislodge the enemy.<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a> Wading through chest-deep water by
night, pulling crude rafts loaded with vehicles, heavy weapons and supplies,
the North Koreans placed an entire reinforced regiment on the
east bank by 8 August. Termite tactics during the next 2 days broadened
their foothold until the Naktong Bulge was overrun by most of the
NKPA 4th Division.</p>

Combat Forces Press, 1954).</p></div>

<p>Consisting of the 5th, 16th, and 18th Infantry Regiments and strongly
supported by artillery and armor, the 4th Division was among the most
distinguished of the major Communist units. With the 107th Tank
Regiment attached at the outset of the invasion, it had breezed through
Uijongbu before sharing in the capture of Seoul. On 5 July 1950, the 4th
became the first NKPA outfit to tangle with the newly arrived United
States Army forces. Task Force Smith delayed it a few hours near Osan,
despite the Reds’ great advantage in numbers and armor. Later, after
capturing Nonsan and aiding in the reduction of Taejon, the unit was
selected to spearhead the assault over the Naktong.</p>

<h3><i>Task Force Hill Organized</i></h3>

<p>In an effort to plug the hole in the Pusan Perimeter, General Walker
attached the 9th Infantry (2d Infantry Division) commanded by Colonel
John G. Hill, to the 24th Division. In turn, General Church placed
Colonel Hill in control of all units in his southern zone and ordered a
counterstroke against the Naktong Bulge.</p>

<p>Task Force Hill attacked on 11 August but lost its momentum in a
confused situation which found the enemy attacking at the same time.
Reinforced to a strength of three infantry regiments, Hill’s provisional
unit again struck out against the bridgehead on 14 and 15 August. After
encountering a stone wall of resistance, the task force was ordered to
cease the attack and defend the ground it occupied east of the enemy
pocket.<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">275</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_275" href="#FNanchor_275" class="fnanchor">275</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>This was the situation as outlined to General Craig at the planning
conference, and he was also briefed on the topography of the target area.
The Naktong Bulge west of Yongsan results from a bend in the river
resembling a stubby thumb pointing westward. Bounded on three sides<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
by the stream, with its inland border formed by a long valley, the bulge
is an isolated terrain feature—a fortress of mountains topped by Hill 311,
the key height.</p>

<p>As the Yongsan road reaches the Bulge from the east, it turns southwest,
winds around Hill 311, and stops at the tip of the “thumb” where
a ferry links it to the road west of the river.</p>

<p>Guarding the eastern approach to the natural fortress are two hills
astride the Yongsan road—Finger Ridge to the north and Hill 207 to
the south. The former is set off on the east by a deep gully containing
the village of Tugok. Eastward from Hill 207 and directly below Tugok
is Obong-ni Ridge—so called because of a village by that name at its
eastern base.</p>

<p>Not only had the NKPA 4th Division overrun the Naktong Bulge;
it had pushed on along the road to Yongsan, seizing Hill 207, Tugok,
and both Finger and Obong-ni Ridges. These latest gains and the Bulge
itself were being consolidated by elements of all three regiments.</p>

<p>Although units were somewhat depleted, at least 6 infantry battalions
occupied the area, supported by 4 mortar companies, over 100 machineguns,
and several artillery pieces. There were 4 or more T-34 tanks within
the bridgehead, and a signal and engineer company for overall support.
As the spoils of earlier victories, particularly the one at Taejon,
enemy arms were generously augmented by a number of American carbines
and two 105-mm. howitzers.<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">276</a></p>

<h3><i>Planning the Next Operation</i></h3>

<p>It was decided by General Church and General Craig at their conference
of 15 August that the entire 24th Division, Reinforced, would assault
the enemy bridgehead at 0800, 17 August, after strong air and artillery
preparations. The 19th and 34th Infantry would converge on the Bulge
from the northeast. In the center, the 9th RCT and the Marine Brigade
would strike frontally astride the MSR, the former on the north of the
road and the latter on the south. The 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry, was to
hold blocking positions in the south to protect the left flank of the
Brigade.<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_277" href="#FNanchor_277" class="fnanchor">277</a> <i>Ibid.</i>; and Brig Op Plan 13-50.</p></div>

<p>On 15 August, front lines in the center of the zone were on Hill 125
and Observation Hill, both defended by the 9th RCT. A thousand yards<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
to the rear, the 34th Infantry occupied Cloverleaf Hill and adjacent high
ground. Before the attack, the Brigade was to relieve the 34th on position
so that the Army unit could move to the north for its assigned mission.
Then, at H-hour, the Marines would jump off from Observation
Hill and seize Obong-ni Ridge—Objective One. Simultaneously, the
9th RCT would drive forward through Tugok and take Finger Ridge,
from which it was to support the Brigade’s advance. The 1st Battalion,
11th Marines, would be under operational control of the 24th Division
artillery commander, and priority for all supporting fires would go to
the Marines.<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">278</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_278" href="#FNanchor_278" class="fnanchor">278</a> Brig Op Plan 13-60</p></div>

<p>During the planning, General Church emphasized that Cloverleaf
Hill must remain occupied and defended until Brigade Objective One
was seized. He considered this hill of utmost importance in blocking
the MSR to the 24th Division CP and Miryang. This collateral responsibility
would tie up a number of Brigade troops and have strong influence
on the tactics used against Obong-ni Ridge.<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_279" href="#FNanchor_279" class="fnanchor">279</a> Craig, 4 Mar 54.</p></div>

<p>Before the conference closed, Church promised Craig that 145 Army
trucks would be available the next day to transport the Marines from
their Miryang bivouac to an assembly area near the line of departure.<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">280</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_280" href="#FNanchor_280" class="fnanchor">280</a> <i>Ibid.</i>; and Brig SAR, basic rpt.</p></div>

<p>At 1900, 15 August, Craig briefed his staff and unit commanders. The
next morning the Brigade commander flew by helicopter to Church’s
CP and received the actual attack order, which was identical with the
planning of the previous day.<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_281" href="#FNanchor_281" class="fnanchor">281</a> Craig, 4 Mar 54.</p></div>

<p>Later on the 16th, Craig drove to the front to reconnoiter the area
marked for the Brigade jump-off. He visited the 9th RCT command
post where Colonel Hill informed him that the Army unit was in good
condition as it stood by for the great attack.<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">282</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_282" href="#FNanchor_282" class="fnanchor">282</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<h3><i>Reconnaissance of Terrain</i></h3>

<p>After Craig’s reconnaissance, Lieutenant Colonel Murray arrived at the
front to discuss the tactical plan with the 9th RCT Commander. Although
Colonel Hill spoke confidently of his outfit’s readiness for the
attack, Murray observed that the ranks of soldiers on Observation Hill
and Hill 125 were dun and the men obviously wearied by the fighting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
of the previous 5 days.<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_283" href="#FNanchor_283" class="fnanchor">283</a> 24th InfDiv Op Instr No. 26 for this period showed the 9th RCT(-) at 47 percent
strength and 44 percent estimated combat efficiency. Morale for the consistently hard-hit
24th Division was gauged “Fair.”</p></div>

<p>With this impression in mind, the 5th Marines commander studied
the terrain soon to be his regiment’s battleground. Between Observation
Hill and Obong-ni Ridge, a 300-yard rice paddy was flanked to the
north of the road by the 9th RCT positions on Hill 125. Across the
MSR from the northern tip of Obong-ni Ridge was the congested village
of Tugok. West of the hamlet and northwest of Brigade Objective
One was long, low Finger Ridge, target of Hill’s RCT.<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_284" href="#FNanchor_284" class="fnanchor">284</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>Murray quickly concluded from the terrain that both regiments
should not attack together and become exposed simultaneously in the
low ground ahead. Since Obong-ni Ridge was closer than the Army objective
and dominated both Tugok and Finger Ridge, Murray suggested
that the 5th Marines jump off alone at 0800, 17 August. If the 9th RCT
would support him by fire from Hill 125, he would cake Obong-ni
Ridge and return the courtesy while the Army unit cleared Tugok and
seized its objective. And though offering his plan on a tactical basis,
Murray also took into consideration the condition and numbers of Hill’s
troops.<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_285" href="#FNanchor_285" class="fnanchor">285</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>The 9th RCT commander agreed, and the responsibility of delivering
the first punch lay with the 5th Marines.<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">286</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_286" href="#FNanchor_286" class="fnanchor">286</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>Time and chance were against the Brigade throughout 16 August and
the following morning. Banking on the use of 145 Army trucks, Craig
and Murray hoped to move quickly on the 16th, in order to have one
infantry battalion take over Observation Hill and the other two available
for the attack on the 17th. Unfortunately, only 43 trucks were
actually provided, with the result that time schedules were thrown off
and troops forced to march long distances the night before the attack.<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_287" href="#FNanchor_287" class="fnanchor">287</a> Brig SAR, basic rpt; Annex How; and Craig, 4 Mar 54.</p></div>

<p>At 1900, 16 August, Lieutenant Colonel Taplett’s 3d Battalion entrucked
at Miryang and rode to the 5th Marines CP about 3,000 yards
behind the front. Dismounting, 3/5 marched to Cloverleaf Hill and relieved
the 34th Infantry on position. Control of the area south of the
MSR passed to Taplett at 0445, 17 August.<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">288</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_288" href="#FNanchor_288" class="fnanchor">288</a> Annex How.</p></div>

<p>The 2d Battalion proceeded on foot to its assembly area near Cloverleaf
Hill at 0130 on the 17th, and Lieutenant Colonel Roise’s men got
little sleep as they prepared for the jump-off a few hours later. Owing to
the shortage of trucks, the 1st Battalion arrived at the forward assembly
area several hours later than planned.<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">289</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_289" href="#FNanchor_289" class="fnanchor">289</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>Overloaded trucks had shuttled Lieutenant Colonel Wood’s artillery
battalion forward on 16 August. Although registration fires were completed
by evening, the haste of the displacement and the doubtful information
at the front left much to be desired from the standpoint of accuracy.<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">290</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_290" href="#FNanchor_290" class="fnanchor">290</a> Annex item to Brig SAR; and Craig, 4 Mar 54.</p></div>

<p>While Obong-ni Ridge was known to be heavily defended, it was
generally thought that Hill 207—Brigade Objective Two—would be the
hard nut to crack. And the potential of Objective Three, towering Hill
311, was by no means minimized in preattack estimates.<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">291</a> Later events
proved these assumptions to be the reverse of reality, but Marine planners
could do no better with the meager intelligence then available.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_291" href="#FNanchor_291" class="fnanchor">291</a> Stewart, 15 Jan 54; Murray, 15 Feb 54.</p></div>

<p>The regimental commander and General Craig concluded that a
frontal assault on Obong-ni Ridge with a column of battalions was the
only answer to the problems posed by the terrain and situation.</p>

<p>Since the Brigade commander had been specifically charged with the
security of the MSR, it was necessary that 3/5 remain in position on
Cloverleaf Hill until Objective One was taken. Taplett’s battalion had
a second responsibility in guarding the Brigade’s left (south) flank, because
Craig considered the 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry, too far out to
provide the required close-in protection.<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">292</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_292" href="#FNanchor_292" class="fnanchor">292</a> Craig, 4 Mar 54.</p></div>

<p>The Brigade commander, unaware of Murray’s arrangement with
Colonel Hill, could not have envisioned an approach to the enemy’s
left through the 9th RCT zone. He expected the Army unit to advance
side by side with the Brigade and give supporting fire as directed by
General Church. On the other hand, an envelopment of the enemy’s
right seemed out of the question. Using the southern approach to
Obong-ni Ridge would have created a gap of several thousands yards
in the center of the critical area, and the low, barren marshland to the
left would have impeded the movement of tanks and the employment
of the 5th Marines’ integral supporting arms.<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">293</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_293" href="#FNanchor_293" class="fnanchor">293</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Murray’s reasoning closely paralleled that of his
superior. He did not visualize an envelopment from the north because
he expected a comparable effect from supporting fire by the 9th RCT.
An attempt to flank the North Korean right would have placed the attacking
unit far from the power consolidated along the MSR. The enemy
situation in the hills and swamps to the south was unknown, and
the Marine regimental commander did not relish the thought of one or
two of his battalions becoming isolated in that remote area. Then too,
the southern peaks on Obong-ni Ridge were considerably higher and
more rugged than those nearer the MSR. So it seemed logical to Murray
to retain depth and strength by striking frontally, quickly gaining
a foothold on the lower, northern reaches of the ridge, then exploiting
the penetration rapidly and vigorously.<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_294" href="#FNanchor_294" class="fnanchor">294</a> Murray, 15 Feb 54.</p></div>

<p>When asked about his tactical plan by General Craig, he stated that
the 5th Marines would attack in a column of battalions, 2/5 seizing Objective
One, 1/5 passing through to take Hill 207, and 3/5 completing
the reduction of the bulge by following with an assault on Objective
Three.<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">295</a></p>

in motion.<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">296</a></p>

<h3><i>Air and Artillery Preparation</i></h3>

<p>Obong-ni Ridge sprawled across the Marine front like some huge prehistoric
reptile. Its blunt head overlooked the MSR below Tugok, and
the elongated body stretched to the southeast more than 2,000 yards before
losing its identity in a complex of swamps and irregular hill formations.
The high, narrow spine was marked by a series of peaks, beginning
with Hill 102 at the neck, followed by 109, 117, 143, 147, and 153. There
were still other peaks to the southeast, but so small and irregular as to
be almost indistinguishable.</p>

<p>A procession of steep spurs, separated from one another by pronounced
gullies, ran down from the numbered peaks to the rice paddies
far below. At the top of a gully extending down from the saddle
between Hills 109 and 117 was a fault caused by erosion of the red clay
and shale. Gaping like an ugly wound, the raw blemish inspired one of
the ridge’s first names—“Red Slash Hill.” It was also dubbed “No<span class="pagenum"><a class="hidep" id="Page_180">180</a><a id="Page_181">181</a></span>
Name Ridge” by some of the newspaper correspondents.</p>

<p>Marine air and artillery were to pound the ridge on 17 August from

as planned; but due either to the hasty registration of the previous day
or to error on the part of observers, the shelling was not effective against
the enemy on Objective One. It was so inacurrate, in fact, that many
officers of 2/5 thought there had been no preparation at all.<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">298</a> To make
matters worse, air attacks scheduled to begin at 0725 did not materialize
until 0740; and the 18 Corsairs assigned to the job had time for only
one strike before H-hour.<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">299</a></p>

<p>The two rifle companies of the 2d Battalion jumped off abreast at
0800. On the right was Captain Zimmer’s Company D, emerging into
the open from the road cut between Hill 125 and Observation Hill.<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">300</a></p>

Shinka, ltr to author, 7 Jun 54.</p></div>

<p>Zimmer ordered the 2d Platoon into reserve on the southern spur of
Hill 125 and established his OP there. The 3d Platoon, commanded by
Second Lieutenant Michael J. Shinka, stepped from the road bend below
the spur into the rice paddy. Advancing behind this unit were the 1st
Platoon and a rocket section, the latter stopping in positions along the
road bend to protect the MSR.</p>

<p>Halfway across the rice paddy, Staff Sergeant T. Albert Crowson led
his 1st Platoon to the right from behind the 3d, and both units approached
the base of the ridge on line. On Shinka’s left was the 2d Platoon
of Company E. An eerie silence pervaded the front while the
assault platoons crossed the wide open area unmolested.</p>

<p>Providing covering fire from its positions on Hill 125, Technical Sergeant
Sidney S. Dickerson’s 2d Platoon was hit by long-range machinegun
bursts from Hills 117 and 143 on Obong-ni. Company D’s first two
casualties were taken.</p>

<h3><i>Company D on Objective</i></h3>

<p>While General Craig watched from the road cut, and Lieutenant Colonel
Roise from his OP on Observation Hill, Company D’s assault<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
platoons began to ascend the objective. Gradually turning its back on
the village of Tugok, Crowson’s unit traced the draw on the right of the
spur leading to Hill 102, while Shinka led his 3d Platoon up the gully
on the left. The infantrymen were almost halfway up the slope when a
battalion of the NKPA 18th Regiment opened fire with dozens of machineguns.</p>

<p>Despite the hail of lead, Shinka and Crowson edged their units upwards.
The fire from Hills 117 and 143 finally became so intense, however,
that the 3d Platoon was momentarily unable to emerge from its
gully. Almost simultaneously, enemy machineguns poured it into the
1st Platoon, pinning that unit down and inflicting heavy casualties.</p>

<p>Again pushing upward despite mounting casualties, the 3d Platoon
attempted to assault Hill 109 about 1000. Communist automatic weapons
and a shower of hand grenades from the crest sent the thin skirmish
line of Marines reeling back down the barren slope.</p>

<p>As the 3d Platoon came under increasing machinegun and mortar fire
from Hills 117 and 143, Zimmer decided to commit his reserve. Realizing
the apparent futility of pressing the attack up the 3d Platoon’s gully,
he ordered Dickerson to attempt an assault through the draw in which
the 1st Platoon was pinned down.</p>

<p>The 2d Platoon crossed the rice paddy, following the route used
earlier by the 3d. Reaching the draw in which the latter was regrouping
after its abortive assault, Dickerson led his men over Hill 102’s spur, attempting
to gain the avenue of approach being used by Crowson’s unit.
In the process he came under heavy automatic weapons fire from both
flanks—Hills 117 and 143 on the left, and the hillside north of Tugok
across the MSR.</p>

<p>At this time the company commander spotted North Korean positions
above the village and realized why his pinned-down 1st Platoon
was taking so many casualties. From their vantage point in the 9th RCT
zone, the Communists were firing on the flank and rear of the Marines
along the northwest approaches of Objective One.</p>

<p>Zimmer requested that 2/5 lay supporting fires on Tugok. When he
got no response, his forward observer, Lieutenant Wirth, transferred the
mission to 1/11. But the 105’s had scarcely begun firing when they were
cut off because the impact area was in the 9th RCT’s zone. The company
commander turned his own 60-mm. mortars on the enemy machineguns,
only to discover that the target lay beyond effective range.</p>

<p>Zimmer had more success with supporting arms when the enemy
posed another threat. Practically all the machinegun fire had been coming<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
from the north and south of Hills 102 and 109, while the enemy on
these summits relied on rifles and vast numbers of hand grenades. Then,
apparently shaken by the 3d Platoon’s tenacity, the Communists tried to
wheel a heavy machinegun into position on the saddle between the
northernmost peaks. Twice the mounted weapon was hauled up, and
twice pulled back under heavy Marine fire. By this time Zimmer had requested
battalion to use a 75-mm. recoilless rifle on the target. When
the persistent North Koreans wheeled the machinegun onto the saddle
a third time, one round from a Marine 75 obliterated gun and crew.</p>

<p>With only 15 men left in his platoon, Shinka prepared for a second
assault on Hill 109. Following an air strike at 1100, the Marines stormed
the high ground and overran enemy positions on the crest. Only a squad
of North Koreans could show similar determination on the reverse
slope, but the enemy’s small-scale counterattack was stopped cold by
Company D’s riflemen.</p>

<p>One of the few Marines who reached Obong-ni’s summit during 2/5’s
attack and lived to tell the story, Shinka later related the events following
his seizure of Hill 109:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Fire from Hill 143 was gaining in intensity, and they had observation over our
position. Fire was also coming from the hill to our front [Hill 207]. I reported the
situation to Captain Zimmer. A short time later phosphorus shells were exploding
in Hill 143. This slowed the fire but it never did stop.</p>

<p>“My resupply of ammo did not arrive. Running short of ammo and taking casualties,
with the shallow enemy slit trenches for cover, I decided to fall back until some
of the fire on my left flank could be silenced. I gave the word to withdraw and take
all wounded and weapons. About three-quarters of the way down, I had the men
set up where cover was available. I had six men who were able to fight.</p>

<p>“I decided to go forward to find out if we left any of our wounded. As I crawled
along our former position (on the crest of Hill 109), I came across a wounded Marine
between two dead. As I grabbed him under the arms and pulled him from the
foxhole, a bullet shattered my chin. Blood ran into my throat and I couldn’t breath.
I tossed a grenade at a gook crawling up the slope, didn’t wait for it to explode,
turned and reached under the Marine’s arms and dragged him as far as the military
crest.</p>

<p>“Another bullet hit my right arm, and the force spun me around. I rolled down
the hill for a considerable distance before I could stop myself.</p>

<p>“I walked into my lines and had a battle dressing tied on my face and arm, I
learned that the ammo was up and that a relief was contemplated; and then I
walked back to 2/5’s aid station where they placed me on a jeep and took me to
regimental aid.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Lieutenant Shinka was later awarded the Bronze Star for this action.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span></p>

<h3><i>Attack of Company E</i></h3>

<p>At 0800 Lieutenant Sweeney had ordered his 1st and 2d Platoons of Easy
Company into the attack from their line of departure on the southern
portion of Observation Hill. Although the boundary separating the
zones of Companies E and D extended from the left of Hill 109 and
down through the red slash, Sweeney centered his advance on the village
of Obong-ni, directly below Hills 143 and 147.<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">301</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_301" href="#FNanchor_301" class="fnanchor">301</a> This section is derived from: Annex How; and Sweeney, 22 May 54.</p></div>

<p>The leading platoons encountered nothing more than scattered shots
crossing the rice paddy. Before they could gain a foothold on the slope
of the objective, however, heavy fire from the village ripped into the
skirmish line.</p>

<p>In the center, Second Lieutenant Nickolas A. Arkadis led his 1st Platoon
through the hail of bullets and drove through the village to the
slopes of the ridge. On the right the 2d Platoon faltered and lost its
momentum. Then a number of North Korean machineguns poured in
flanking fire from Hills 147 and 153.</p>

<p>Sweeney, from his OP on the southern slope of Observation Hill,
tried to get an artillery mission on the two dominating peaks, but his
forward observer was unable to contact the rear. Nor could the 4.2 mortar
observer be located.</p>

<p>Faced with the necessity of giving his assault elements some protection,
the company commander committed 2d Lieutenant Rodger E.
Eddy’s 3d Platoon, sending it to the spur on the left of the village.
Working its way up the nose which led to Hills 147 and 153, Eddy’s
unit was able to concentrate its fire on the enemy-held peaks and relieve
pressure on the other two platoons.</p>

<p>With enemy fire gradually increasing from new positions on the
lower slopes of the ridge to the south of the village, Sweeney ordered
the mortar section and all of his headquarters personnel into the valley
to block the southern approach through the rice paddy. Leaving this
flank guard in command of his executive officer, First Lieutenant Paul
R. Uffelman, the company commander rushed to the base of the objective.
Every single man in his unit was now committed.</p>

<p>Sweeney found the 2d Platoon leaderless and disorganized. The 1st
had fought its way well up the slope, aided by excellent supporting fire
from 2/5’s 81-mm. mortars. As that dogged group of Marines neared
the crest, it was stopped when a friendly artillery barrage fell short,<span class="pagenum"><a class="hidep" id="Page_185">185</a><a id="Page_186">186</a></span>
searing the skirmish line with white phosphorus.</p>

<div id="ip_185" class="figcenter port">

  <div class="caption"><p>1st NAKTONG COUNTEROFFENSIVE<br />
  <span class="smaller">SITUATION 17 AUG.—OBJ. 1 (OBONG-NI RIDGE)</span></p></div></div>

<p>Late morning found part of the company closing on the crest; but
shortly before 1130, the attackers were ordered to pull back in preparation
for an air strike by MAG-33. The planes came in quickly, and some
of Company E’s men, within 25 yards of the summit, were caught in the
strafing.</p>

<p>During the hammering by the Corsairs, the 3d Platoon slipped back
100 yards, leaving the critical left flank open to enemy-infested peaks
147 and 153. This time the hail of enfilade fire from Communist machineguns
caught the remnant of Easy Company rifleman exposed on
the higher slopes, and the Marine advance crumbled.</p>

<p>By noon on 17 August, the 2d Battalion, 5th Marines was wobbling.
In 4 hours of fighting it had lost 23 dead and 119 wounded, practically
all of the casualties being taken by the 2 rifle companies. Every
officer in the Brigade could lament the lack of a third company in each
battalion; for just when 2/5’s assault needed the added punch of a reserve
unit, the outcome of battle had to rest on the failing strength of
six depleted rifle platoons. The ridge could not be taken.</p>

<p>This was unfortunate, since there was clear evidence that the NKPA
4th Division was weakening. Although not apparent to the men of
Companies D and E, their repeated attempts to carry the ridge had torn
gaps in the enemy’s defenses. Bodies, weapons and wreckage were
strewn along the entire northern crest.<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">302</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_302" href="#FNanchor_302" class="fnanchor">302</a> LtGen E. A. Craig, ltr to author. 17 Mar 54 (Craig, 17 Mar 54); Annex Easy to
Brig SAR.</p></div>

<p>Marine air and artillery, having settled down after a fumbling start,
not only blasted the North Korean lines, but also wrought havoc
throughout the entire bridgehead. A large number of enemy mortars
and field pieces were knocked out, troop concentrations cut down or
scattered while trying to reinforce the front lines, and supply points
obliterated. There were definite signs of increasing confusion in the enemy’s
rear.<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">303</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_303" href="#FNanchor_303" class="fnanchor">303</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>General Craig had become alarmed at the lack of activity in the 9th
RCT’s zone, resulting in the enemy being left free to pound the Brigade’s
right flank from the Tugok area. When he inquired concerning
the Army’s supposed failure to advance on schedule, he first learned of
the prebattle agreement reached by Murray and Hill. It was then that he
requested the village be taken under fire.</p>

<p>Deeply concerned himself over the situation on the right, particularly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
since no supporting fire at all had been received from the 9th RCT,
Murray tried to contact Hill and request that he commit his regiment.
Unable to get the message through immediately, he was forced to leave
the matter dangling while directing the conduct of the battle.<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">304</a></p>

<p>About 1300 the 5th Marines commander ordered the 1st Battalion to
pass through the 2d and seize Obong-ni Ridge. While Newton moved
his unit forward from its assembly area, MAG-33, 1/11 and Able Company
tanks laid down devastating fires on the blackened objective.</p>

<p class="drop-cap b"><span class="smcap1">Shortly after 1330, while</span> reporting his situation to the battalion
commander, Captain Zimmer was wounded by enemy machinegun
fire which ripped into his OP and caused several other casualties. Crawling
to the company CP on the reverse slope of the spur, he turned his
command over to Lieutenant Hanifin, who went forward. Zimmer then
joined the steady stream of casualties returning through the road cut to
the battalion aid station.<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">305</a></p>

ltr to author, 8 May 54 (Fenton, 8 May 54).</p></div>

<p>On the way, he met Captain Tobin leading Company B forward for
the attack, and paused long enough to warn him about the enemy guns
in Tugok.</p>

<p>Company D, its part in the battle having come to an end, prepared to
withdraw to positions on Observation Hill. The long list of wounded
for 17 August included the names of Dickerson and Wirth.<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">306</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_306" href="#FNanchor_306" class="fnanchor">306</a> Lt Wirth was actually attached from 1/11.</p></div>

<p>Newton established his OP near that of Roise on Observation Hill.
The 1st Battalion CP and aid station were set up with those of 2/5
immediately behind the road cut, while farther back Major John W.
Russell placed 1/5’s Weapons Company in position.</p>

<h3><i>Company B to the Attack</i></h3>

<p>Tobin deployed his 3d Platoon and machineguns on the forward slopes
of Observation Hill to support Company B’s attack. The 1st and 2d<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
Platoons, the latter on the left, crossed the rice paddy and at 1500 passed
through Company D on the slopes of the objective. Lieutenant Schryver
led his 1st Platoon toward Hill 102 along the same avenue used by
Crowson before him, while Lieutenant Taylor moved the 2d Platoon up
the gully leading to the saddle between 102 and 109.</p>

<p>On Observation Hill Captain Tobin noted the rapidity of the advance
and called his executive officer, Captain Fenton, preparatory to joining
the two assault units. While briefing his assistant at the road bend, he
was felled by a burst of machinegun fire. Fenton directed the evacuation
of the seriously wounded officer, then took command of the company
and joined the attackers on the ridge.</p>

<p>By this time both assault platoons had been pinned down, the 1st
about two-thirds of the way up the slope, the 2d only half that distance.
The latter was taking heavy casualties from Communist guns on Hills
109, 117, and 143, Taylor himself sustaining a mortal wound.</p>

<p>Fenton and his gunnery sergeant, Master Sergeant Edward A. Wright,
were stalled with the 2d Platoon. Since Schryver’s unit was also held up,
the company commander radioed Observation Hill and committed his
3d Platoon.</p>

<p>Schryver realized that the main obstacle to his advance was the fire
hitting his flank from Tugok, and he requested a fire mission from 1/5’s
Weapons Company. As 81-mm. mortar shells rained down on the village,
the 1st Platoon worked westward to the spur above the MSR and
outflanked the NKPA 18th Regiment. A quick assault carried Hill 102
at 1710.</p>

<p>With Schryver’s men driving down from the south and Company B’s
machineguns pouring fire on peaks 117 and 143, the 2d Platoon barreled
its way up the draw and seized Hill 109 at 1725.</p>

<h3><i>Advance of Company A</i></h3>

<p>Leaving the line of departure from the southern reaches of Observation
Hill, the 1st and 2d Platoons of Company A crossed the rice paddy while
Marine air and artillery savagely blasted the forward and reverse slopes
of the objective. The two assault units, each with a machinegun section
attached, passed through Company E at 1500 and scrambled up the
scarred hillside.<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">307</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span></p>

USMC Ret., interv with author, 5–6 Jan 54 (Muetzel, 5–6 Jan 54).</p></div>

<p>Sweeney’s battle-worn company withdrew, carrying its dead and
wounded back to Observation Hill. The list of casualties included Lieutenant
Arkadis, wounded while spearheading the unit’s advance.</p>

<p>As Company A’s assault wave passed the halfway point of ascent, it
met only sniping fire from the crest and forward slopes of Obong-ni
Ridge. But any delusions that the enemy had quit were soon shattered
when the summit suddenly came alive with Communist machineguns.</p>

<p>Intense fire poured down on the attackers, and Marines pitched forward
to roll limply down the hillside. First Lieutenant Robert C. Sebilian,
leading the 1st Platoon up the draw between Hills 109 and 117, ignored
the storm of steel and urged his men forward. Standing fully exposed
while pointing out enemy positions to his NCO’s, the young officer was
struck by an explosive bullet which shattered his leg. Technical Sergeant
Orval F. McMullen took command and resolutely pressed the attack.</p>

<p>The 1st Platoon reached the saddle above the draw just as Company
B was taking Hill 109. When McMullen tried to advance southward to
117, he and his men were pinned down by a solid sheet of Communist
fire.</p>

<p>On the left, North Korean guns had already cut Second Lieutenant
Thomas H. Johnston’s 2d Platoon in half. The pint-sized platoon leader
proved to be a giant in courage. He pushed doggedly up the draw between
Hills 117 and 143, but casualties bled his skirmish line white and
finally brought it to a stop.</p>

<p>Marines watching the battle from Observation Hill saw Company A’s
attack bog down, despite the ceaseless pounding of Hills 117 and 143 by
Brigade supporting arms. Startled, the observers noted a lone figure who
bolted forward from the 2d Platoon’s draw and stubbornly scrambled up
the hill. It was Johnston attempting a single-handed assault on the core
of enemy resistance.</p>

<p>The astonished onlookers saw him reach the saddle north of Hill 143.
That he survived to this point was remarkable enough, yet he continued
to push forward. Then, at the base of the blazing peak, the little figure
sagged to the ground and lay motionless.</p>

<p>Technical Sergeant Frank J. Lawson immediately took over the platoon,
displaying outstanding leadership in his attempt to continue the attack.
Communist guns and grenades prevailed, however, and again the line of
infantrymen stalled. The 2d Platoon now consisted of a squad.</p>

<p>Captain Stevens radioed Lieutenant Colonel Newton from his OP and
requested permission to commit his 3d Platoon, then deployed on Observation
Hill as battalion reserve. The request granted, First Lieutenant<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
George C. Fox led the platoon forward into the rice paddy just as a
heavy mortar barrage fell in the area. One of Fox’s men was killed
outright.</p>

<p>Moving quickly to Obong-ni Ridge and ascending the slope, the 3d
Platoon was joined by Lawson and the remnants of Johnston’s outfit.
The skirmish line passed the critical halfway point, and again enemy
machineguns and grenades opened up.</p>

<p>Twice Fox attempted to develop an assault, failing both times to get
his platoon through the curtain of fire above the gully. While Technical
Sergeant Stanley G. Millar was reorganizing the skirmish line, the platoon
leader and Private First Class Benjamin C. Simpson of the 2d
Platoon made an attempt to reach Johnston.</p>

<p>The pair climbed to a point above the gully from which Simpson
could see the fallen officer. Assured now that Johnston was dead, and
unable to recover the body because of interlocking machinegun fire
across the area, Fox and the rifleman slid down the draw to the 3d
Platoon lines.</p>

<p>By this time Stevens had moved to the base of Obong-ni Ridge, but
he had lost radio contact with the three units high on the hillside. He
could see the combined 2d and 3d Platoons; but the 1st was out of sight,
leaving the company commander unaware of a limited success that could
have been exploited.</p>

<h3><i>Defeat of Enemy Tanks</i></h3>

<p>Shortly after 2/5’s jump-off on 17 August, the M-26’s of the 3d Platoon,
Able Company Tanks, moved forward of the road cut and supported the
advance by 90-mm. and machinegun fire. The Marine armor, led by
Second Lieutenant Granville G. Sweet, concentrated on heavy NKPA
weapons along the crest of Objective One and knocked out at least 12
antitank guns and several automatic weapons. In return, 1 M-26 withstood
3 direct hits by enemy mortars, and the 4 vehicles combined were
struck by a total of 23 antitank projectiles. Neither tanks nor crews were
bothered appreciably, and only one man was slightly wounded.<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">308</a></p>

Office, Johns Hopkins University (cover ltr: OIC RS Cleveland, ser. 527–53, 31 Dec 53).</p></div>

<p>After the 1st Battalion had passed through 2/5, a section of tanks
moved forward on the road and blasted several North Korean positions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
in Tugok. When Company B seized the northern tip of the objective,
Sweet led all his vehicles back to the tank CP, 1,000 yards east of
Observation Hill.</p>

<p>At 2000, while still refueling and replenishing ammunition stocks, the
tankmen learned that four enemy T-34’s were approaching the Brigade
lines on the MSR. The Marine armor was clanking toward the front
within a matter of seconds. About 300 yards from the road cut, the
tankmen had to jump from their vehicles to remove trucks blocking the
MSR. Then, approaching the narrow defile, Sweet ordered his 1st Section
to load with 90-mm. armor-piercing shells.</p>

<p>Company B, consolidating its positions on Hills 102 and 109, had first
noticed the four NKPA tanks and a column of infantry moving toward
its lines at 2000. Corsairs of MAG-33 screamed down immediately, destroying
the fourth armored vehicle and dispersing the Red riflemen.
The first three tanks came on alone, passed Finger and Obong-ni Ridges,
and approached the road bend at Hill 125.</p>

<p>Preparing a reception for the T-34’s were the 1st 75-mm. Recoilless
Gun Platoon on Observation Hill, and the rocket section of 1/5’s antitank
assault platoon on Hill 125. As the first enemy tank reached the
bend, it took a hit in the right track from a 3.5″ rocket. Shooting wildly,
the black hulk continued until its left track and front armor were
blasted by Second Lieutenant Paul R. Fields’ 75’s. The enemy vehicle
burst into flame as it wobbled around the curve and came face to face
with Technical Sergeant Cecil R. Fullerton’s M-26.</p>

<p>Still aimlessly firing its 85-mm. rifle and machinegun, the T-34 took
two quick hits from the Marine tank’s 90-mm. gun and exploded. One
North Korean got out of the burning vehicle but was cut down instantly
by rifle fire. He crawled beneath the blazing wreckage and died.</p>

<p>The second T-34 charged toward the bend, taking a 3.5 rocket hit
from Company A’s assault squad. Weaving crazily around the curve,
with its right track damaged, the cripple was struck in the gas tank by a
rocket from 1/5’s assault section before meeting the fury of Field’s recoilless
rifles. It lurched to a stop off the road behind the first tank, and
the 85-mm. gun fired across the valley into the blue yonder.</p>

<p>By this time a second M-26 had squeezed next to that of Fullerton on
the narrow firing line, and the two Marine tanks blasted the T-34 with
six 90-mm. shells. Miraculously, the Communist vehicle kept on shooting,
although its fire was directionless. Marine armor poured in seven
more rounds, which ripped through the turret and exploded the hull.</p>

<p>Before the kill, one Red tankman opened the turret hatch in an effort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
to escape. A 2.36″ white phosphorus round, fired by a 1st Battalion
rocket man, struck the open lid and richocheted into the turret. The
enemy soldier was knocked back into the tank as the interior turned into
a furnace.</p>

<p>The third T-34 raced around the road bend to a stop behind the blazing
hulks of the first two. Marine tanks, recoilless rifles, and rockets
ripped into it with a thundering salvo. The enemy tank shuddered, then
erupted in a violent explosion and died.</p>

<p>Thus the Brigade shattered the myth of the T-34 in five flaming
minutes. Not only Corsairs and M-26’s, but also every antitank weapon
organic to Marine infantry had scored an assist in defeating the Communist
armor.</p>

<h3><i>End of the First Day</i></h3>

<p>Throughout 17 August the evacuation of dead and wounded had been a
major concern of every Marine, from fire team leaders up to the Brigade
commander. Men risked their lives dragging casualties off the blazing
slopes of Obong-ni Ridge to relative safety at the base. Litter bearers
plodded back and forth across the fire-swept rice paddy, and a steady
stream of wounded passed through the 1st and 2d Battalion aid stations
behind the road cut. Medical officers of the two battalions, Lieutenants
(jg) Bentley G. Nelson and Chester L. Klein, worked tirelessly with
their corpsmen.</p>

<p>In the rear, Lieutenant Commander Byron D. Casteel had to commandeer
every ambulance in the area—including 16 Army vehicles—to
evacuate wounded to and from his 5th Marines aid station. So acute was
the shortage of hospital corpsmen that the Brigade’s Malaria and Epidemic
Control Unit was used to reinforce the regimental medical staff.
Even so, the hospital tents were busy for a straight 18 hours.<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">309</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_309" href="#FNanchor_309" class="fnanchor">309</a> Annexes Love and Tare to Brig SAR.</p></div>

<p>The small number of deaths from wounds attested to the speed and
effectiveness of helicopter evacuations; for the pilots of VMO-6 were
ferrying the more serious casualties from the regimental aid station to
the Army’s 8076 Surgical Hospital at Miryang, some 20 miles away.</p>

<p>While medics toiled to save lives, the spiritual needs of casualties were
filled by the inspiring labor of the 5th Marines’ naval chaplains, Lieutenant
Commander Orlando Ingvolstad, Jr., Lieutenant William G.
Tennant, and Lieutenant (jg) Bernard L. Hickey. A familiar figure at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
front, frequently exposed to enemy fire as he administered to fallen Marines,
was Lieutenant Commander Otto E. Sporrer, beloved chaplain
of 1/11.</p>

<p>Two serious obstacles to the various missions behind the front were
the dud-infested area east of Observation Hill and a section of collapsed
MSR in the river bed occupied by the 5th Marines CP. First Lieutenant
Wayne E. Richards and his 2d Platoon, Able Company Engineers, spent
most of 17 August at the tedious task of removing unexploded missiles
from the forward assembly areas. The engineers’ 1st Platoon had to tear
down part of an unoccupied village for material to reinforce the sinking
road over which the jeep ambulances and supply trucks were struggling.</p>

<p>As the sun dropped behind Obong-ni Ridge, activity on the MSR
continued unabated, although the battle for Objective One had diminished
to a crackle of rifle fire and occasional machinegun bursts.</p>

<p>Company A had been unable to take Hills 117 and 143, still bristling
with enemy automatic weapons. At 2030, shortly after the smashing victory
over North Korean armor, Captain Stevens contacted his 1st Platoon
and learned that it was on the saddle between peaks 109 and 117.
Although tied in on the right with Company B, the platoon was separated
by a 100-yard gap from Stevens’ other two platoons on the slopes
to the left.<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">310</a></p>

<p>The company commander called Fox, Lawson, and McMullen together
near the base of the ridge to consult them on continuing the attack. All
platoon leaders advised against it, since darkness was falling and their
units needed rest, food, water, and ammunition. Moreover, the enemy’s
bold tank attack had convinced the infantry leaders that a larger counterstroke
by the Communists was imminent, and they wanted time for
preparation.<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">311</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_311" href="#FNanchor_311" class="fnanchor">311</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>Stevens informed Newton of the situation by radio, and the battalion
commander ordered him to discontinue the attack and tie in with
Fenton’s unit for the night. It was already dark when the 2d and 3d Platoons
shifted to the right from their positions below Hills 117 and 143.</p>

<p>Company B had been busily consolidating its high ground since the
seizure of Hills 102 and 109 earlier in the evening. While Fenton’s machineguns
dueled with those of the Reds on 117, his 1st and 2d Platoons
deployed defensively on the forward slopes of the two captured peaks,
and the 3d went into reserve on the reverse slope.<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">312</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span></p>

<p>Company A’s front extended left from the southern part of Hill 109—where
the 1st Platoon was linked to Fenton’s unit—to the center of the
saddle toward 117. There the line bent down in an arch, formed by the
2d Platoon, to the spur below the enemy-held peak. Able Company’s
left was actually perpendicular to the ridgeline, for Fox’s 3d Platoon
was deployed up and down Hill 117’s spur.<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">313</a></p>

<p>To complete the Brigade front, Headquarters Company of 1/5 was
to have extended across the rice paddy from Observation Hill and tied
in with Company A’s left flank. Due to the casualties and workload of
the headquarters troops, this connection was never made, with the result
that Fox’s platoon remained dangling.<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">314</a></p>

<p>When General Craig returned to his CP near Yongsan on the night
of 17 August, he was not unduly concerned about the tactical situation.
Although the Brigade had been thinned by heavy casualties, Murray’s
disposition in depth across a narrow front gave the Marines the advantages
of concentrated strength and firepower. If the enemy attempted his
usual night envelopment, both 2/5 and 3/5 could strike back from their
reserve positions on Observation and Cloverleaf Hills.<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">315</a></p>

<p>Across the MSR, the 9th RCT had launched its attack earlier in the
evening, clearing Tugok and seizing Finger Ridge against negligible resistance.
By darkness, the 19th and 34th Regiments were also sitting on
their objectives to the north, leaving the 4th NKPA Division clamped
in a vice. To the southeast, the 1st Battalion, 21st Infantry, was holding
its blocking position with no difficulty.<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">316</a></p>

<h3><i>Enemy Counterattack on Ridge</i></h3>

<p>Late on 17 August, when the attack on Obong-ni Ridge ceased, General
Craig sent a message to his subordinate commanders, directing them to
“... consolidate positions for night, account for location of each individual
and be prepared for counterattack; carefully prepare plan of fires
for night to include plans for fires within and in rear of positions; wire
in where possible in front line elements.”<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">317</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_317" href="#FNanchor_317" class="fnanchor">317</a> This section is derived from: Annex How; Stevens and Fox, 24 Feb 54; Muetzel, 5–6
Jan 54; and Fenton, 8 May 54.</p></div>

<p>Long after nightfall, the weary Marines of both front line companies
were still digging foxholes and organizing their defenses. While this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
work continued in spite of sporadic Communist fire from Hill 117, the
South Korean laborers were transporting supplies to the ridgeline or
carrying casualties back to the rear.</p>

<p>Captain Stevens established Company A’s command post at the top of
the draw leading to the saddle between Hills 109 and 117. His 60-mm.
mortar section set up its weapons in the gully itself.</p>

<p>Shortly before 2200, the telltale whine and rattle of mortar shells cut
through the darkness and the men of Able Company crouched in their
holes. The explosions were followed by a shower of fire as white phosphorus
enveloped the center of the company area. Almost every man in
the gully was painfully wounded, leaving Stevens without a mortar section.
The edge of the barrage hit the 3d Platoon’s area, wounding Fox
and several of his men. Two riflemen had to be evacuated, but the platoon
leader and the others applied first aid and remained in the line.</p>

<p>After this brief flurry the front settled down to an ominous quiet
interrupted only occasionally by North Korean guns to the south.</p>

<p>At 0230 on 18 August, the Marines of Company A heard enemy
movement on Hill 117. Suddenly there was a hail of bullets from Communist
machineguns on the peak, and hand grenades began to roll down
into the Marine positions. A North Korean platoon made a few bounds
from the high ground and landed almost literally on top of Stevens’
depleted 2d Platoon.</p>

<p>Simultaneously, Company B’s position on Hill 109 was struck hard
by two platoons advancing up the draw to the west. Heedless of illuminating
shells fired by 1/5’s 81-mm. mortars, the enemy assaulted methodically
by alternately throwing small groups of grenadiers and submachinegunners
against Marine positions. The NKPA infantrymen were
covered by a heavy volume of automatic weapons fire pouring down
from Hill 117.</p>

<p>An enemy squad emerged from the gully west of the saddle between
peaks 102 and 109, attempting to divert strength from Fenton’s main
defensive effort to the south. Failing in this effort, the group fell back
to fire harassing shots.</p>

<p>Company A’s 2d Platoon slugged it out with three times its own
numbers for a full half hour. This stand was due largely to the courage
and leadership of Lawson, who stuck to his guns and refused evacuation,
though wounded three times. About 0300, with Marines on the right
devoting more attention to the heavier attack against Hill 109, the exhausted
survivors of the 2d Platoon were overrun and the Brigade line
penetrated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
For some unknown reason, enemy troops did not pour down the
eastern slopes after the breakthrough. Only one squad drove through,
and it split Company A in half by invading Stevens’ CP, directly behind
the 2d Platoon’s lines. The company commander and his headquarters
were slowly forced down the draw by the methodical grenade and
submachinegun fire from above.</p>

<p>The remainder of the North Korean platoon which had hit Company
A remained on the crest for a joint effort with the larger force striking
Hill 109. Stevens’ 1st Platoon, with its left flank now exposed on the
saddle, gradually fell back and curled around the southern face of 109.</p>

<p>Although Company B’s left front held firm against the two-platoon
assault, a few Reds slipped by the Marine foxholes and charged into
Fenton’s CP on Hill 109. Rocket gunners, mortarmen and clerks
responded to the challenge and quickly eliminated the attackers.</p>

<p>When Fenton became aware that the saddle south of Hill 109 had
been taken, he tightened his left flank by drawing it in to his 3d Platoon’s
reverse slope positions. This portion of his defense now took the
shape of a football, and successfully withstood pressure from the south.</p>

<p>By 0400 Stevens had temporarily lost control of Company A, although
the situation looked worse than it actually was. While the company
commander stabilized his center near the bottom of the draw, his executive
officer, First Lieutenant Fred F. Eubanks, Jr., made single-handed
forays up the gully. He was eventually aided in his private war by the
company’s machinegun officer, Second Lieutenant Francis W. Muetzel.
After the breakthrough, the latter had been wounded and left for dead
in his foxhole behind the 2d Platoon. Upon regaining consciousness, he
made his way down the draw, fighting it out with enemy soldiers until
he reached the Marine lines. Company A’s 3d Platoon along the spur
below Hill 117 enjoyed a seemingly illogical immunity during the counterattack.
Although isolated after the penetration and deployed ideally
from the enemy’s point of view, Fox’s men had only occasional brushes
with Red infantrymen who displayed a remarkable lack of interest. After
the platoon leader learned of the situation on his right, he redeployed
into an elongated perimeter which included a few survivors of the 2d
Platoon.</p>

<div id="ip_199" class="figcenter port">

  <div class="caption"><p>1st NAKTONG COUNTEROFFENSIVE<br />
  <span class="smaller">SITUATION 18 AUG.—OBJ. 1 (OBONG-NI)</span></p></div></div>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Newton, when notified of Company A’s withdrawal
on the left front, called down such a tremendous volume of artillery
fire on enemy approaches that 1/11 asked him to conserve a few
shells for the Brigade attack scheduled for 0700. The battalion commander
replied that the Brigade would be fighting to retake Objective<span class="pagenum"><a class="hidep" id="Page_199">199</a><a id="Page_200">200</a></span>
One at 0700 if his beleaguered companies did not get maximum supporting
fire. While the artillerymen continued to pound Obong-ni
Ridge, Newton’s 81-mm. mortars, strengthened by 2/5’s entire stock of
ammunition, added to the hot metal thrown at the enemy. It can only
be conjectured why the NKPA thrust against the Brigade lines never
developed above the company level, but Newton’s generosity with high
explosives probably did not encourage Communist aspirations.</p>

<h3><i>Obong-ni Ridge Secured</i></h3>

<p>By dawn of 18 August, the North Korean attackers had spent their
strength, leaving Company B in undisputed control of Hills 102 and 109.
As if in frustration, enemy machineguns on 117 spat angrily at the
Marines while the few surviving Red infantrymen withdrew to their
lines.</p>

<p>Stevens prepared at first light to complete the unfinished business of
the previous day. Thanks to the heroism of his wounded gunnery sergeant,
Technical Sergeant Paul A. Hodge, the company commander had
regained contact with Fox before dawn and was able to prepare for an
attack. At 0700, after moving forward to the 3d Platoon’s area and clearing
with Newton, he ordered Fox to continue the attack and seize Hill
117.</p>

<p>The platoon leader shouted to his men who arose as a body to begin
the ascent. When a lone Red machinegun broke the silence on 117,
Stevens spotted the weapon immediately and called for an air strike.
Within seconds a Marine fighter plane glided over the 3d Platoon and
dropped a 500-pound bomb squarely on the enemy position. The response
from Marine air had been so prompt that every one of the attackers
was knocked off his feet and one of Fox’s automatic riflemen was
killed.</p>

<p>While the echoes of the shattering explosion were still reverberating
through the morning haze, the thin skirmish line of Marines scrambled
up the slope and carried Hill 117. McMullen’s 1st Platoon drove in from
109, and the North Koreans fled in panic from the crest and reverse
slope positions. A full company of Reds raced down the western slope,
with Stevens’ riflemen and machinegunners firing from the crest to rip
into the enemy groups.</p>

<p>Capitalizing on a psychological advantage, Company A wheeled
southward to sweep the crest. Fox, using a skirmish line of only 20 men,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
assaulted Hill 143 and took the peak against light resistance. A quick
call to Newton brought Stevens immediate permission for maximum
exploitation.</p>

<p>The 3d Platoon attacked Hill 147 vigorously, and though a few Red
soldiers fought to the bitter end, the majority again chose to flee. The
high ground was taken easily.</p>

<p>As the Marines moved over the crest of 147, they saw 150 enemy
troops in formation halfway down the western slope. The withdrawal
commenced in an orderly column of fours but the formation broke down
quickly under Marine fire and turned into a routed mob.</p>

<p>Fox turned his attention to Hill 153, Obong-ni’s crowning peak, reasoning
that it would be the logical place for the enemy’s last-ditch stand.
But it was the same old story when the 3d Platoon rushed to the summit—abandoned
weapons and equipment, a few scattered dead, and
blasted foxholes. There was a variation, however, when a supposed
clump of scrub pines arose from the reverse slope and rushed downward
in headlong flight. The Leathernecks were reminded of Birnham Wood
in Shakespeare’s <i>Macbeth</i> as the camouflaged North Koreans disappeared
with the agility of mountain goats before Marine marksmen
could score more than a few hits.</p>

<p>While the 1st and 2d Platoons consolidated the central peaks, the 3d
combed the southern reaches below Hill 153 without incident. The 1st
Platoon, Able Company Engineers, patrolled the swampland south of
the ridge and secured Fox’s left flank with a minefield extending from
the southern crest to the valley below and eastward across the swamp.
By midafternoon all of Obong-ni Ridge belonged to the Brigade.</p>

<h3><i>Supporting Arms Clear the Bulge</i></h3>

<p>At midnight, 17 August, Lieutenant Colonel Murray had issued 3/5
a warning order for continuing the attack on the 18th. Shortly after
dawn, Taplett and his two company commanders, Fegan and Bohn,
visually reconnoitered Hill 207—Objective Two—from vantage points
north and south of the MSR. Then, while the battalion commander set
up his OP on the northern part of Obong-ni Ridge, Companies G and
H advanced to an assembly area at the base of the Ridge.<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">318</a></p>

<p>Taplett called down heavy artillery, air, and mortar preparations on<span class="pagenum"><a class="hidep" id="Page_202">202</a><a id="Page_203">203</a></span>
Objective Two. Occasionally he shifted fires to blast large groups of
enemy fleeing to Hill 207 from Company A’s advance on Obong-ni
Ridge.</p>

<div id="ip_202" class="figcenter land">
  <img src="images/i_202.jpg" width="2085" height="1342" alt="" />
  <div class="caption"><p>1st NAKTONG COUNTERATTACK<br />
  <span class="smaller">SEIZURE OF OBJ. 2—18 AUG.</span></p></div></div>

<p>Directly south of Finger Ridge, two large spurs form the northern
approach to Hill 207. Company H emerged into the open at 1000 from
the MSR between Obong-ni and Finger Ridges and attacked up the
eastern spur. Following Fegan’s unit was Company G, which veered to
the right and advanced up the western spur. The two infantry units
slowly ascended, separated by a deep gully, while the 3d Platoon of Able
Company tanks fired overhead and to the flanks from its positions in the
valley.</p>

<p>When Fegan’s unit was halfway up the eastern spur, the Marine tankmen
saw a platoon of North Koreans attempting to flank the attackers.
Machinegun and 90-mm. fire from the M-26’s killed or dispersed the
Reds at a range of 300 yards.</p>

<p>As Lieutenant Williams worked How Company’s 1st Platoon close
enough for an assault of the summit, several NKPA soldiers rose from
their holes and threw down hand grenades. The Marines hit the deck
until the missiles exploded, then bounded up and rushed the crest. Unnerved
by Williams’ perfect timing, most of the North Koreans fled
southward along the ridge. The remainder died in their positions during
a brief but bitter fight.</p>

<p>Moving up on Fegan’s right, Bohn’s men pushed over the western
half of the objective, finding only a handful of enemy who were quickly
destroyed. Company G’s assault completed the seizure of Objective Two
at 1237.</p>

<p>During the last minutes of the fight on Hill 207, the entire Naktong
Bulge suddenly swarmed with panic-stricken remnants of the 4th NKPA
Division. What had been a retreat of small forces now became a widespread
rout. Enemy troops poured down from Objective Two, some
scurrying up the slopes of Hill 311 across the MSR, others making for
the Naktong River.</p>

<p>Air, artillery, and mortars were now offered a profusion of targets by
an enemy who ordinarily did not reveal himself during daylight hours.
MAG-33 plastered the suspected CP of the 18th NKPA Regiment on a
peak south of 207, shattering communications equipment and weapons.
Other Marine planes alternated strafing runs with 1/11’s continual artillery
barrages along the river banks, where enemy troops were gathering
by the hundreds.</p>

<p>Victory turned into slaughter when the Brigade supporting arms<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
concentrated on the masses of Communists plunging into the river. All
artillery having been turned loose on the river crossings, Taplett used his
mortars, machineguns, and the supporting tanks to cut down targets in
the valley and on Hills 207 and 311. He requested permission to attack
the latter immediately, but was told to remain on Objective Two while
the Brigade gave all of its attention to the astounding situation at the
river.</p>

<p>At 1530 Companies G and H descended Hill 207. They were met at
the bottom by First Lieutenant Pomeroy’s 1st Platoon of tanks and
escorted across the valley to the base of Hill 311—Objective Three. In
advance of the infantrymen, MAG-33 scorched the high ground with
napalm while artillery, mortars, and 75-mm. recoilless rifles worked over
the slopes.</p>

<p>Again Fegan and Bohn moved up companion spurs which converged
on their target, the 1,000-foot height. Progress was good until Company
H came within 200 yards of the crest. Then a volley of rifle fire from the
summit and forward slopes forced the Marines to the ground. Although
confronted by only a platoon, Fegan was at a disadvantage. Scrub growth
not only concealed the Communist riflemen, but also prevented the use
of Company H’s machineguns. Maneuver to the right or left was impossible,
since the steep draws on either side were well covered by camouflaged
enemy positions. Several Marines who tried to advance frontally
were cut down by rifle fire.</p>

<p>The enemy platoon’s defense was not based on the usual machinegun
fire and grenade throwing. With calm, business-like efficiency, NKPA
riflemen kept Company H pinned to the ground, finally wounding
Fegan himself as the officer attempted to regain the initiative. After his
evacuation, the attack bogged down completely.</p>

<p>At 1730, Company G had reached the southern portion of the long,
narrow crest by brushing aside light resistance. Turning its attention
northward, the company entered into a small-arms duel with the Communist
force opposing Fegan’s unit. When supporting arms failed to
dislodge the enemy rifleman, Bohn enveloped the troublesome pocket
by sending Cahill’s 1st Platoon around to the left (west).</p>

<p>The young platoon leader completed the maneuver just before nightfall
and overran the Reds on the northern half of the summit. But the
enemy on the forward slopes facing Company H suddenly showed fight.
The 1st Platoon, pushed rearward a short distance by the surprise resistance,
slugged it out at close quarters.</p>

<p>With darkness closing in and the platoon so far beyond Marines lines,<span class="pagenum"><a class="hidep" id="Page_205">205</a><a id="Page_206">206</a></span>
Bohn ordered it to withdraw. Cahill, wounded himself, reported on his
return that the platoon had suffered 10 casualties, including 2 killed.</p>

<div id="ip_205" class="figcenter land">

  <div class="caption"><p>1<i>st</i> NAKTONG COUNTEROFFENSIVE<br />

<p>Taplett ordered the two companies to deploy defensively in their
present positions. Thus, during the quiet night of 18–19 August, Companies
G and H faced the enemy pocket at right angles to each other.</p>

<p>Earlier on the 18th Lieutenant (jg) Robert J. Harvey, 3d Battalion
surgeon, had the unpleasant task of examining an abandoned Army aid
station under the bridge near the tip of Finger Ridge. The improvised
hospital had been overrun during Army reverses a week before; and
about 30 dead found by the Marines bore mute evidence of the enemy’s
brutality in dealing with captured wounded and medical personnel.</p>

<p>At 0610 on the morning of 19 August, 3/5’s 81-mm. mortars prepared
the way for the final drive on Objective Three. Following close in the
wake of the mortar bursts, Second Lieutenant Thomas P. Lennon led
Company H through evacuated enemy positions. He reached the northern
part of Hill 311 without meeting any opposition.</p>

<p>This last Brigade objective was secured at 0645, leaving 1/5 atop
Obong-ni Ridge, 2/5 on Hill 207 to which it had displaced on the 18th,
and 3/5 in possession of the dominating height of the Naktong Bulge.
The reduction of the enemy bridgehead cost the Marines 66 dead, 1
missing in action, and 278 wounded.</p>

to the Naktong Bulge—All-Out NKPA Offensive—The Marines
Jump Off—Progress of Brigade Attack—Assault on Hill 117</i></p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">It was all</span> over but the mopping-up operations. Battalion areas were
carefully patrolled on 19 August to clear them of NKPA snipers or
stragglers. During this process a patrol ranging along the Naktong river
discovered three enemy 122-mm. howitzers hidden in a strip of woods
on a hill. The pieces had not been touched by Marine air or artillery.
What was more surprising, they were emplaced in a column to fire over
one another—something new and wonderful that the Marines had never
seen before.<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">319</a> General Craig concluded that these howitzers had fired the
shells which landed on Marine positions to the bitter end.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_319" href="#FNanchor_319" class="fnanchor">319</a> This section is derived from: LtGen Edward A. Craig (Ret), ltr to author, 23 May 54
(Craig, 23 May 54).</p></div>

<p>The next day the Brigade commander took a helicopter to 24th Division
Headquarters to confer with General Church. There he was informed
that the Marines had been detached from 24th Division
operational control to Eighth Army reserve. Church complimented the
Brigade warmly on its performance, and letters of commendation were
later received both from him and CG EUSAK.</p>

<p>At 1300 on the 21st Craig arrived by helicopter at a new Brigade
bivouac area near Masan that was to be recorded in capital letters as the
Bean Patch. It was just that—a bean patch large enough to accommodate
a brigade. But from this historic spot the Marines were to fight their
way around the peninsula during the next 5 months and complete the
circuit to their identical starting point.</p>

<p>General Craig arrived along with the Brigade advance elements. After
setting up his CP, he reported to General Kean, of the 25th Division,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
who was in control of the bivouac area. Kean divulged that the situation
in his sector had deteriorated. The enemy had made several penetrations,
and Brigade assistance might be required in the event of further breakthroughs.
As it was, Kean had been authorized by Eighth Army to employ
Brigade artillery along with his own; and 1/11 proceeded the next
day to the familiar Chindong-ni area in support of 25th Division
Infantry.</p>

<p>Orders were received from Eighth Army for the Brigade infantry to be
prepared to counterattack in the 25th Division sector as part of its reserve
mission. General Craig and Lieutenant Colonel Stewart made a
helicopter reconnaissance of the areas of greatest activity, but events
proved that the Marine rifle battalions were not needed.</p>

<h3><i>The Famous Bean Patch</i></h3>

<p>Unit training, including the checking and firing of all weapons, was
conducted at the Bean Patch; and Marine patrols were sent out to the
rear of the 25th Division to watch for infiltrating forces. Patrols in
rugged country were fed hot meals delivered in special containers by the
versatile helicopters of VMO-6.</p>

<p>Truckloads of supplies rolled in daily from Pusan, including some of
the equipment left behind at the docks when the Brigade landed. But
no tentage was available, and the exhausting marches of combat had
forced the men to discard everything except fighting tools. In the lack of
shelter tents, therefore, the Marines lived in the open at the Bean Patch.</p>

<p>General Craig conferred on 23 August with General Kean and a distinguished
visitor, General J. Lawton Collins, Chief of Staff, USA.
Collins was keenly interested in Marine methods of knocking out NKPA
tanks and requested Craig to prepare a memorandum on the subject.</p>

<p>That evening the entire Brigade attended an outdoor entertainment
given on an improvised stage by South Korean girls, who sang and
played native instruments which sounded out of tune to Western ears.
Translations of the songs were forthcoming, since some of the girls were
English-speaking refugees from Seoul University. Afterwards, General
Craig addressed the Brigade, paying a high tribute to his Marines for
their conduct in battle. NKPA prisoners, he said, had told G-2 interviewers
that they earnestly wished to steer clear of “the Americans in
yellow leggings.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
Letters from home and beer from Pusan<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">320</a> contributed to good Marine
morale, even though no liberty was granted to nearby towns. On the
29th an honor guard of 87 Marines received Purple Heart medals at a
ceremony attended by President Syngman Rhee, who arrived in a helicopter
provided by VMO-6. General Craig had paid an official call on
him the day before at Chinhae, being most courteously received. And
after the presentation of medals, President Rhee gave a talk to the
Marines.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_320" href="#FNanchor_320" class="fnanchor">320</a> The offer of Stateside breweries to send free beer to Korea precipitated a controversy
in civilian circles. Opponents protested on the grounds that some of the troops were as
young as 18. Proponents argued that if a man was old enough to fight, he was mature
enough to drink a can of beer without harm. The issue was never definitely settled, though
it resulted in a temporary drought.</p></div>

<p>He confided to Craig afterwards that he would like to confer some
sort of an award on every man in the Brigade for heroic service in Korea.
This was undoubtedly the inception of the Korean Presidential Unit
Citation which the Brigade later received from the ROK executive.</p>

<h3><i>Planning for Inchon Landing</i></h3>

<p>General Craig, it may be recalled, had insisted that replacements be sent
to the Brigade. Thanks to his determination, a long column of trucks
arrived at the Bean Patch with more than 800 Marines just landed at
Pusan.</p>

<p>Some of the 5th Marines outfits had been so thinned by combat that
an appeal was made for volunteers from supporting units to serve temporarily
in rifle companies, with the privilege of returning to their
former status after the emergency. The hearty response was a tribute to
Marine morale as well as Marine basic training which made every man a
potential rifleman. Engineers, shore party troops and headquarters personnel
came forward in such numbers that some could not be accepted
after the arrival of replacements eased the situation.</p>

<p>No attempt was made at the Bean Patch to form the newcomers into
third rifle companies. They were simply used to build up the strength of
the present companies and given intensive unit training.</p>

<p>Rumors of an impending Marine amphibious operation had already
filtered down to every PFC, and there were wild speculations as to when
and where. At least, it could hardly be denied that the Brigade would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
soon be taking another voyage; for convoys of tracks left the Bean Patch
every day laden with heavy supplies and equipment to be unloaded at
Pusan.<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">321</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_321" href="#FNanchor_321" class="fnanchor">321</a> Brig SAR.</p></div>

<p>This was once that lower-echelon “scuttlebutt” came close to the
mark. In fact, planning for the Inchon landing had already gone so far
that General Craig sent his chief of staff, G-3 and G-4 to Tokyo
to confer with staff officers of the 1st Marine Division about the projected
operation.<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">322</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_322" href="#FNanchor_322" class="fnanchor">322</a> Craig, 23 May 54.</p></div>

<p>Major General Oliver P. Smith, CG of the 1st Marine Division, had
relieved General Erskine early in July when the latter was sent on a
secret State Department mission. As the ADC of the Division during
the fight for Peleliu in 1944, Smith knew how tough an amphibious operation
can become when it encounters unexpected obstacles. He was
determined to keep his Division intact with its three infantry regiments,
the 1st, 5th, and 7th Marines. And after his arrival in Japan with the advance
party, he returned a firm negative to proposals that the 5th Marines
and other Brigade troops remain with the Eighth Army.</p>

<p>It would be putting the case mildly to say that this was the eleventh
hour, The 1st Marine Division (less the 7th Marines) had landed at
Kobe from 28 August to 3 September. And though a typhoon caused a
good deal of damage, little time was lost at the gigantic task of unloading
mixed-type shipping and combat-loading it into assault-type shipping.
The LST’s had to be ready to sail for the target area by 10
September, and the transports by the 12th.</p>

<p>The Marines at the Bean Patch would have been flattered to know
that they were the objects of an official tug of war at Tokyo. It was
maintained by the EUSAK command and staff that Army morale would
be hurt by taking the Brigade away from the Pusan Perimeter at a critical
moment. On the other hand, General Smith contended that he
needed the Brigade all the more urgently because the 7th Marines,<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">323</a> sailing
belatedly from San Diego, would not be able to reach Inchon until a
week after the proposed D-day of 15 September 1950.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_323" href="#FNanchor_323" class="fnanchor">323</a> Less a battalion making the voyage from the Mediterranean, where it had been afloat
with the Sixth Fleet.</p></div>

<p>The Marine general was informed that the decision would depend
upon the tactical situation in Korea. On 30 August he sent a dispatch to
X Corps—the new Army tactical organization activated by CINCFE
especially for the Inchon operation—requesting that the Brigade be released<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
from its Army commitments on 1 September. In response, General
MacArthur issued an order restoring the unit to the 1st Marine
Division on the 4th.<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">324</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_324" href="#FNanchor_324" class="fnanchor">324</a> MCBS, I-II-B-4-6.</p></div>

<p>At this point the enemy rudely interrupted by launching an all-out
offensive against the Pusan Perimeter on 1 September, and General
MacArthur’s order was rescinded. Even though most of the Brigade’s
heavy equipment was at the Pusan docks, waiting for shipping,
GHQFEC decided that General Craig’s troops should again be used as
“firemen” to extinguish an NKPA conflagration.</p>

<p>Colonel Edward H. Forney, the Marine officer recently named deputy
chief of staff of X Corps, suggested to General Smith the possibility of
substituting an Army unit, the 32d Infantry of the 7th Infantry Division,
for the 5th Marines. Smith demurred on the grounds that these
troops had not been trained for amphibious warfare.</p>

<p>On 3 September, with D-day less than 2 weeks away, a conference was
held in Tokyo to decide the question once and for all. X Corps was represented
by General Wright, the G-3, and General Edward S. Almond,
the new commanding general and former chief of staff, GHQFEC.
COMNAVFE (Admiral Joy), COMSEVENTHFLT (Admiral Struble)
and COMPHIBGRUONE (Admiral Doyle) were the Navy officers
present. General Almond opened the discussion by reiterating that the
32d Infantry would be substituted for the 5th Marines. In reply, General
Smith mentioned the complications of an amphibious assault landing
and urged that the operations plan be amended if the untrained Army
regiment were to be employed.</p>

<p>Another solution, offered by Admiral Struble, was baited with reciprocal
concessions. He suggested that the Brigade be employed briefly for
counterattacks in the Pusan Perimeter, but that meanwhile the 32d or
some other 7th Infantry Division regiment be moved from Japan to
Korea. There it would become a floating reserve for EUSAK, thus releasing
the Brigade units to take their former places in the 1st Marine
Division for the Inchon operation. This compromise was finally accepted,
and orders were issued for the Brigade to be withdrawn from
Eighth Army control at midnight on 5 September.</p>

<p>The first intimations to reach the troops at the Bean Patch were received
on the 1st, at 0810, when the Brigade was alerted for a possible
move by CG EUSAK to an unknown destination. At 1109 came
the warning order for a road lift to the Miryang assembly area. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
confirmation followed at 1215, with all units being scheduled to move
out at 1330.<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">325</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_325" href="#FNanchor_325" class="fnanchor">325</a> Brig SAR.</p></div>

<p>The Marines had another date with destiny.</p>

<h3><i>Return to the Naktong Bulge</i></h3>

<p>General Craig set up his CP in the Miryang area at 1800 on 1 September.
Billeting officers, having gone ahead by helicopter, were prepared
to take care of Brigade units as they arrived. Among them was the 1st
Battalion of the 11th Marines, which had been returned from 25th Division
control to the Brigade.</p>

<p>The news from the front was depressing. Heavy attacks had been received
all day along the 2d and 25th Infantry Division fronts. An enemy
penetration of 4,000 yards was made at the expense of the 2d Division,
with the old familiar Naktong Bulge being occupied again by Red
Koreans who had gained a firm foothold on the east bank of the river.</p>

<p>This meant that General Craig’s men, now under operational control
of the 2d Division, were likely to revisit some scarred parcels of Korean
real estate they had hoped never to see again. Major General Lawrence
B. Keiser, commanding the 2d Division, informed the Brigade commander
that several of his companies had been cut off by enemy advances
which pushed his lines back almost to Yongsan.<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">326</a> There was a
good deal of NKPA infiltration, he added, in his rear.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_326" href="#FNanchor_326" class="fnanchor">326</a> Craig, 23 May 54.</p></div>

<p>It had been a full day, and at 2230 that night Craig received orders
from the Eighth Army to move the Brigade at first light to a reserve
position south of Yongsan and in the rear of the 9th Infantry of the 2d
Division.</p>

<p>At 0630, on 2 September, the 2d Battalion of the 5th Marines arrived
at its assigned covering position on the road leading to Yongsan. The
remainder of the Brigade moved out to assembly positions during the
day.<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">327</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_327" href="#FNanchor_327" class="fnanchor">327</a> Brig SAR.</p></div>

<p>Craig proceeded by helicopter at 0830 to the 2d Infantry Division
headquarters for a conference with Keiser to plan the move of the Brigade
into his lines. Afterwards, the Marine general devoted the rest of
the morning to reconnaissance of the terrain by helicopter. On the way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
he stopped at Lieutenant Colonel Murray’s CP and learned that the
5th Marines units were well established along the road leading to the
front.</p>

<p>The planning conference for the projected counterattack began at 1430
in the 2d Infantry Division CP. General Craig was accompanied by his
assistant G-3, Major Frank R. Stewart, Jr., since his regular G-3 had not
yet returned from the 1st Marine Division briefing at Tokyo. General
Keiser and his staff officers emphasized the gravity of the situation in
the 2d Division sector. They wanted General Craig to counterattack that
very afternoon on a widely extended front, but he objected on both
counts.</p>

<p>As for the time element, he pointed out that the hour was late. Some
of his units were not even in their assembly positions, and others were
still detraining or in trucks. Smoke and haze had resulted in such low
visibility that planes could not operate effectively. Finally, Craig’s
TACRON had not arrived and he was out of touch with the aircraft
carriers. He did not wish to commit his force piecemeal without air support;
and in the end the Army staff officers agreed with him on the
advisability of the Marines attacking in the morning.<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">328</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_328" href="#FNanchor_328" class="fnanchor">328</a> Craig, 23 May 54.</p></div>

<p>Next came a discussion as to the nature of the Marine counterattack.
Craig cited the risks and disadvantages of advancing on too wide a front.
He suggested that the 2d Infantry Division specify the Marine objectives
and allow him to attack in such formations as he deemed most effective.
Keiser and his staff assented, and the Marine officers hurried back to the
Brigade CP.</p>

<h3><i>All-Out NKPA Offensive</i></h3>

<p>Glancing at the big picture, there could be no doubt that the enemy
was making an all-out effort to smash through the Pusan Perimeter. Late
in August it became evident that he was massing troops. The blow fell
in the early morning hours of 1 September. The direction of the main
attack remained in doubt until that afternoon, when it was revealed as a
bid for a breakthrough in the Naktong Bulge which would expose the
Pusan-Taegu lifeline.</p>

<p>Despite heavy casualties of the past 2 months, NKPA overall strength
was estimated as high as 133,000 men as the result of filling the ranks<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
with hastily trained replacements. Thirteen infantry regiments, 3 security
regiments and the remnants of the original 3 armored regiments were
believed to be participating in the offensive.<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">329</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_329" href="#FNanchor_329" class="fnanchor">329</a> Maj H. D. Stewart, “Rise and Fall of an Army,” <cite>Military Review</cite>, 30, no. 11:32–35
(Feb 51).</p></div>

<p>For 2 months the Eighth Army had been purchasing time with space,
and the enemy realized that time was now fighting on the side of the
United Nations. The first ground force unit sent by a member nation to
reinforce United States and ROK troops was the British 27th Infantry
Brigade, which landed and took over a sector early in September. But the
enemy knew that other UN contingents had been promised.</p>

<p>The reorganized ROK army, moreover, had recovered from its early
disasters and was giving a good account of itself in the northern sectors
of the Pusan Perimeter. There the 1st, 3d, 6th, 8th, and Capital Divisions
had not only maintained their tactical integrity throughout August
but even delivered several counterattacks.<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">330</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_330" href="#FNanchor_330" class="fnanchor">330</a> U. S. Dept of State, “Fifth Report to the Security Council, October 5, 1950,” <cite>United
Nations Action in Korea under Unified Command</cite> (Washington: GPO, 1950).</p></div>

<p>The NKPA numerical superiority, in short, could not last much
longer. It was now or never if the invaders hoped to batter their way to
Pusan, and Pyongyang staked everything on a final offensive.</p>

<p>The brunt fell upon the United States 2d Infantry Division. Troops
from four enemy divisions were identified on this sensitive front, well
supported by armor and artillery. Within a few hours pressure became
so great that EUSAK decided to send the Marine mobile reserve to the
aid of the Army troops.</p>

<p>Not only was the terrain familiar to Marines who had fought their
way up Obong-ni Ridge, but they were renewing acquaintance with the
same enemy outfit. For G-2 reports confirmed that the NKPA 4th
Infantry Division was back again at the old stand—or at least such
survivors as had emerged with a whole skin from their defeat of 17–18
August in this area.</p>

<p>Perhaps because of the large numbers of new recruits filling the ranks,
the retreaded outfit followed in reserve just behind the NKPA 9th
Infantry Division as it crossed the Naktong and drove eastward. The 9th
was one of the enemy units hastily raised from constabulary forces for
purposes of the invasion. Assigned to guard duty at Seoul throughout
July and half of August, the troops devoted themselves wholeheartedly
to the pleasant mission of forcing South Koreans to “volunteer” as
soldiers or laborers against their own people. Thus the division could be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
considered a fresh and rested outfit, though deficient in training and
combat discipline as compared to the older NKPA units.</p>

<p>Troops from the enemy’s 2d and 10th Divisions were also identified
on the front of the United States 2d Infantry Division, but the Marines
had no contacts with these units.<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">331</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_331" href="#FNanchor_331" class="fnanchor">331</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<h3><i>The Marines Jump Off</i></h3>

<p>General Keiser’s operational directive for the 3 September counterattack
was half a page in length. As in the case of the first Naktong counterstroke,
the Marine brigade was placed opposite the center of the Bulge,
with the mission of driving westward “to restore former 9th Infantry
positions.” This time, however, Craig’s force was scheduled to jump off
4 miles east of Observation Hill; for the North Koreans were knocking
at the gates of Yongsan.</p>

<p>The Brigade’s line of departure was a long north-south ridgeline about
a thousand yards west of Yongsan and directly south of Myong-ni. This
high ground was occupied on 2 September by the 9th Infantry. When
the Marines passed through the next morning, the Army unit was to
swing northward to attack on the Brigade right. Still farther north, the
23d Infantry had orders to hold positions on the right of the 9th and
maintain contact with friendly units by patrolling.<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">332</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_332" href="#FNanchor_332" class="fnanchor">332</a> 2d InfDiv Op Dir, 2 Sep 50; and Brig Op Order 19-50.</p></div>

<p>On the Brigade’s left, a special task force of the Army’s 72d Tank Battalion
and 2d Engineer Battalion was to attack southward from Il-li to
the Naktong River line below the Bulge. There it would link with the
25th Division’s right.</p>

<p>The fact that the Communists upset the plan by smashing through
the 9th Infantry lines on the night of 2–3 September was both bad and
good news from the standpoint of the Marines. It was bad because an
overextended friendly unit had been shattered by many times its numbers
and forced into a disorganized withdrawal. It was good because the
enemy was plowing ahead at full steam, obviously unaware that he was
shortly due for a blow that would find him off balance and send him
reeling.</p>

<p>Low hanging clouds and smoke made for poor visibility on the morning
of the 3d when General Craig set out on his customary prebattle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
reconnaissance by helicopter. He was accompanied by Lieutenant Colonel
Stewart, who had just returned from the 1st Marine Division
planning conferences at Tokyo.</p>

<p>“We couldn’t see anything but an occasional mountain peak,” Craig
recalled at a later date. “After flying around for some time, we had
almost decided to return to the CP and complete the tour by jeep. Then
Colonel Stewart noticed a hole in the clouds, and we dropped to an
altitude where we had a good view of the front.”<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">333</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_333" href="#FNanchor_333" class="fnanchor">333</a> Craig, 23 May 54.</p></div>

<p>What Craig and Stewart saw was a long column of Marines fighting
their way toward the line of departure.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Colonel Murray’s plan of attack for the 5th Marines called
for the 1st and 2d Battalions to advance westward astride the Yongsan
road, with 2/5 on the right. Taplett’s 3d Battalion would initially be in
reserve, blocking the southern approaches to Yongsan.<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">334</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_334" href="#FNanchor_334" class="fnanchor">334</a> Annex How.</p></div>

<p>At 0450, 3 September, 2/5 detrucked about 800 yards from Yongsan
and marched forward in a route column. Moving into the town a short
time later, the Marines received small arms fire from snipers hidden in
buildings, ditches and culverts. Most of them were liquidated as the
column pushed through to the road junction at the western end of
Yongsan by 0630.<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">335</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_335" href="#FNanchor_335" class="fnanchor">335</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>At this fork a secondary route branches from the main road through
the large village of Myong-ni, about 2,000 yards northwest of Yongsan.</p>

<p>Although still 1,000 yards from the designated line of departure, the
2d Battalion came under moderate fire from its right front. Moreover,
dawn had brought indications of considerable activity and confusion
ahead of the Marines. Ignoring the fire, Roise went forward about 500
yards to a low hill lying athwart the MSR. There he was jolted by the

<p>On the right of the road there was no friendly situation worthy of the
name. To the left of the MSR, an Army tank unit was parked behind the
little hill which Roise had reached, and to the front were 4 of its tanks—2
destroyed and 2 abandoned. Included in the wreckage ahead were 2
burned-out NKPA T-34’s.</p>

<p>Three hundred yards to the west, on the high ground south of the
main road, Army troops were retreating from 1/5’s line of departure.
The soldiers had buckled under an onslaught by the NKPA 9th Division,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
which had launched an all-out attack at first light.<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">337</a></p>

<p>Having observed evidence of the confusing situation from their helicopter,
Craig and Stewart landed some distance behind Yongsan and
proceeded forward by jeep and foot. The Brigade commander located
1/5’s CP south of Yongsan and discovered that the battalion was slightly
out of position. During 2/5’s delay in moving through the city, Murray
had ordered Newton to swing westward and align his unit for the attack
as best he could. Darkness, coupled with confusion caused by the Army’s
withdrawal and 2/5’s fight, had caused the 1st Battalion to move south
of Chukchon-ni instead of Yongsan, as planned. Craig instructed 1/5’s
commander to make a 500-yard correction northward during the actual
attack.<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">338</a></p>

<p>Roise was meanwhile taking the situation in hand north of the MSR.
At 0645 he called Marine tanks forward to cover the withdrawal of 9th
Infantry troops from the high ridge in 1/5’s zone.</p>

<p>Second Lieutenant Robert M. Winter led his platoon of M-26’s into
hull defilade next to 2/5’s OP on the low hill and unleashed overhead
fire in support of the Army troops. The pursuit by the North Koreans
began to lag.</p>

<h3><i>Progress of Brigade Attack</i></h3>

<p>Despite enemy artillery fire in the 2d Battalion zone, Companies D and
E jumped off from the road junction at 0715 to clear the Yongsan-Myong-ni
road and secure the 5th Marines’ right flank.<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">339</a></p>

Col G. R. Newton, Maj J. R. Stevens, and Capt G. C. Fox); and Craig, 23 May 54.</p></div>

<p>While this move was in progress, the last of the 9th Infantry troops
vacated 1/5’s line of departure to the left front. Roise immediately
smothered that ridgeline with fire from Marine tanks, artillery, air, mortars,
and machineguns.</p>

<p>Despite this blanket of steel, enemy guns from the high ground were
able to fire across the MSR at Company E as it cleared a series of hills
below Myong-ni. These hills had been designated 2/5’s line of departure
the previous day, but now were considered part of the first objective.</p>

<p>At 0800, when Captain Samuel Jaskilka reported that Easy Company
had completed its mission, Roise ordered Company D to push through
Myong-ni and take the hill just northwest of that village.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
By this time the entire Brigade was shifting into high gear. Winter’s
tanks on the little hill straddling the MSR were joined by the 1st Platoon,
Able Company Engineers. The Army armored unit behind the
southern portion of the hill suddenly went into hull defilade and added
its firepower to that of the Marine M-26’s. Craig, Snedeker and Stewart
crawled to the crest of the hill on the right side of the MSR and studied
the front from positions between the Marine tanks and Roise’s OP.</p>

<p>The NKPA 9th Division had been stopped in its tracks when the
Brigade’s supporting arms connected. Then the Reds concentrated their
fire on the little hill where Craig’s OP was located. Lieutenant Winter
was shot through the neck and one of his men wounded while aiding
him. Before being evacuated, the painfully wounded tank officer offered
General Craig a bottle of whiskey left in his M-26.</p>

<p>Chaplains Sporrer and Hickey were taken under machinegun fire as
they walked forward on the MSR toward the hill. “It’s lucky they’re poor
shots,” said Sporrer as a second and third burst cracked over his head.
The two chaplains arrived just in time to administer to the wounded
being carried off the hill by the engineers.</p>

<p>At 0855, the 1st Battalion jumped off from below Chukchon-ni. The
attack having been launched too far to the south, Companies A and B
had to veer northwest as they advanced toward the enemy-held ridge
1,000 yards away. Fenton’s unit was on the right, gradually closing on
the MSR as it moved forward.</p>

<p>To the south, Stevens deployed his 1st, 2d, and 3d Platoons from right
to left in that order, the latter being slightly withheld to protect the
open left flank.</p>

<p>As the men of 1/5 waded into the knee-deep muck of the rice paddy,
they came under long-range small-arms fire from their objective. Newton
countered immediately by plastering the ridge with artillery and
mortar fire. The advance continued and only a few casualties were taken
by the time the companies reached a drainage ditch midway across the
rice paddy. Here the long skirmish line paused to check its direction and
place the wounded on dikes where they would be seen by corpsmen.</p>

<p>During the advance from the drainage ditch to the base of the ridge,
1/5’s commander frequently called on air, artillery and mortars to blast
enemy automatic weapons on the crest and forward slopes of the objective.
Company A had the added support of an Army tank destroyer
which gave overhead fire from the hill south of Chukchon-ni. On one
occasion Marine 75’s joined with the Army weapon to silence Communist
guns in a small village at the base of the ridge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
Throughout the rice-paddy crossing, the Marines were constantly
meeting Army stragglers, some of whom had been isolated in enemy
territory for as long as three days. Most of the soldiers were wounded,
and all were weaponless and near exhaustion.</p>

<p>At 1100 Fenton and Stevens radioed Newton that they were ready for
the assault, and the battalion commander immediately showered the
objective with 81-mm. mortar fire to smother North Korean machineguns.</p>

<p>Beyond the edge of the rice paddy in Company A’s zone, a sharp step
led to the gentle incline at the base of the ridge. After a few yards, the
gradual slope gave way to a steep rise which shot up abruptly to the
crest of the high hill.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Muetzel’s 2d Platoon held up at the step, using its protection
against enemy fire while 1/5’s mortar barrage was falling. During
the pause Technical Sergeant McMullen brought the 1st Platoon into
position on Muetzel’s right and Lieutenant Fox aligned his 3d Platoon
on the left.</p>

<p>As soon as the supporting fire lifted, Muetzel jumped to his feet and
shouted the command to assault. Every man in Company A’s skirmish
line responded by scrambling up the hillside. The Marines made such a
fearful racket that a whole company of alarmed North Koreans suddenly
jumped up from concealed foxholes on the forward slope and fled toward
the summit.</p>

<p>The panic-stricken Reds were easy targets for Company A’s riflemen
and BAR men. Halting on the gentle incline, the Marines carefully took
aim and killed most of the enemy soldiers. When the Communist survivors
disappeared over the crest, Company A again surged upward and
within minutes carried the summit.</p>

<h3><i>Assault on Hill 117</i></h3>

<p>The 1st Battalion secured its initial objective about noon on 3 September.
Company B’s next target was a continuation of the ridge running
parallel to the MSR for 1,000 yards and topped by 4 conspicuous peaks.
Able Company’s second objective was a hill stretching across its front
beyond a 200-yard valley. This hill was connected to Stevens’ first objective
by a narrow razorback ridge on the right which offered a poor route
of approach.<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">340</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_340" href="#FNanchor_340" class="fnanchor">340</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>The two companies paused on their newly won positions to reorganize,
evacuate wounded, and wait for a resupply of ammunition. There
they came under heavy fire from the reverse slopes of their first objective
and the high ground to the west. Several casualties were taken before
Corsairs, requested by Newton, appeared for an air strike. As the Marine
fighter planes unloaded their ordnance, large groups of enemy broke.
Most of the Reds fled down the northern slopes, crossed the MSR and
ascended Hill 117 in 2/5’s zone.</p>

<p>Newton reacted to reports of the rout by throwing heavy artillery fire
across the enemy’s avenues of retreat. The hillsides and road were soon
littered with bodies and equipment.</p>

<p>While 1/5’s attack on its first objective was in progress, Company D
had secured the 5th Marines’ right flank by clearing Myong-ni of moderate
resistance and seizing the hill to the northwest of the large village.
The new company commander, First Lieutenant H. J. Smith, reported
to Roise that he was receiving considerable machinegun and mortar fire
from Hill 117. This high ground lay directly across 2/5’s front, stretching
northward from the MSR to a point about 500 yards west of Myong-ni.</p>

<p>Smith’s reports, together with the news of the enemy’s withdrawal to
Hill 117 from 1/5’s zone, led Roise to order Company D to attack the
high ground from the north and cut off the North Korean retreat.
Shortly after 1200, Smith’s company jumped off to the southwest from
its positions above Myong-ni and fought across the rice paddies circling
the objective.</p>

<p>Company E could not advance from the chain of hills won earlier in
the day because of enemy troops along the high ridge in Baker Company’s
zone south of the MSR. But Jaskilka’s men supported the attack
on 117 by fire.</p>

<p>A platoon of 75’s from First Lieutenant Almarion S. Bailey’s Anti-Tank
Company, taking positions on Jaskilka’s right, quickly knocked
out an enemy gun on the objective. The Communists answered with
85-mm. fire from a concealed T-34 tank, killing 2 and wounding 7 of the
recoilless rifle crews.</p>

<p>Company D gained a foothold on one of Hill 117’s spurs against light
resistance. As the unit advanced south toward the crest, however, enemy
troops pouring across the MSR from 1/5’s zone had boosted the ranks of
the defenders to approximately two battalions. Smith’s company was
caught in its isolated position 500 yards from the rest of 2/5 and blasted
by North Korean artillery, mortars, and automatic weapons. Casualties
mounted at such a staggering rate that the Marines were hard put to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
retain their foothold on the northern tip of the hill.</p>

<p>While the 2d Battalion was maneuvering and fighting on the right of
the road, the 2d Platoon of tanks pushed westward along the MSR from
its early morning position 500 yards west of Yongsan. The Brigade armor
became heavily engaged with enemy antitank weapons, and several casualties
were taken as Marines exposed themselves from unbuttoned
M-26’s to spot Communist emplacements. Second Lieutenant John S.
Carson, who had taken over the platoon after Winter was wounded, fell
before enemy machinegun fire and died instantly.</p>

<p>Going into hull defilade on another low hill overlooking the MSR,
the 2d Platoon surprised three T-34 tanks on the road ahead and quickly
destroyed them with 90-mm. fire. The tankmen then turned their guns
on a wealth of targets spread across the front: Red antitank weapons,
machinegun positions, troop concentrations, and groups either retreating
or attempting to reinforce.</p>

<p>About noon, Second Lieutenant Sweet’s 3d Platoon joined the 2d and
added its firepower to the fusillade. Another T-34 was knocked out when
Sweet’s men blasted a thicket suspected of concealing an antitank gun.
A fifth North Korean tank went out of action when it was abandoned
by its crew on the left side of the road.</p>

<p>In the afternoon of 3 September, enemy resistance across 1/5’s front
weakened proportionately as it grew stronger in the 2d Battalion zone.
Newton launched his attack on Objective Two at 1510, after MAG-33
and 1/11 had softened up the North Korean positions.<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">341</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_341" href="#FNanchor_341" class="fnanchor">341</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>Company B drove down the ridgeline paralleling the MSR and in
little more than an hour had seized its part of the objective, a peak
directly across the road from Hill 117. During the 1,000-yard advance,
Fenton reported another large group of enemy fleeing to 2/5’s zone. The
information was quickly relayed to Roise, who had ample reason by this
time to curse the fortunes of war.</p>

<p>In Company A’s zone, Stevens and his platoon leaders worked out a
classic scheme of maneuver for seizing Hill 91, their part of the battalion
objective. McMullen’s 1st Platoon and the company machineguns were
to remain in position as the base of fire, while Muetzel’s 2d Platoon
feinted across the 200-yard valley to the front. Fox’s 3d Platoon, earmarked
for the main effort, would then circle to the south and flank the
enemy’s right.</p>

<div id="ip_223" class="figcenter port">
  <img src="images/i_223.jpg" width="1393" height="2119" alt="" />
  <div class="caption">2nd NAKTONG COUNTEROFFENSIVE</div></div>

<p>Muetzel’s unit jumped off with Company B at 1510, crossed the low<span class="pagenum"><a class="hidep" id="Page_223">223</a><a id="Page_224">224</a></span>
ground, and ascended a draw leading to Hill 91. The Marines miscalculated,
however, and climbed too far up the slope, so that they came
within grenade range of the crest and were pinned down by machinegun
fire. The platoon was split, with Muetzel and two squads on the left of
the draw and Corporal Raymond E. Stephens and his squad on the right.</p>

<p>During the preparatory artillery barrage, Fox had led his platoon
around to the enemy’s right Hank, concealed en route by a rice-paddy
bank. Not knowing when the supporting fire would lift, he withheld
his squads from an assault line by a wide safety margin. Thus when
the artillery ceased, the North Koreans had time to come out of their
holes and hit the envelopment with small arms fire. Fox was wounded,
and command passed to Technical Sergeant George W. Bolkow who
worked the platoon up into the enemy positions.</p>

<p>The 3d Platoon’s assault was sparked by Corporal Virgil W. Henderson
and his 3d Squad, who worked to the rear of a troublesome machinegun
position and destroyed it. During the attack Henderson was
painfully wounded in the jaw by a Communist bullet.</p>

<p>Since both forward platoons had SCR 300 radios, Muetzel heard the
report that Fox was wounded. Concluding that the envelopment had
faded, the 2d Platoon leader requested and received permission to make
a frontal assault on Hill 91 from his position on the forward slopes.
Enemy mortar fire had added to the woes of Muetzel’s diversionary
thrust. And though an OY-2 of VMO-6 had given information leading
to the destruction of the mortar position, the beleaguered platoon leader
sought the relative safety of a frontal assault.</p>

<p>Corporal Stephens, acting on his own initiative across the draw, had
worked his squad up to the razorback ridge and around the enemy’s left
flank. Thus the hapless North Koreans on Hill 91 were hit by a “triple
envelopment” when Stephens struck from the north, Muetzel from the
east and Bolkow from the south.</p>

<p>Company A reported its objective seized at 1630, and Newton ordered
Stevens and Fenton to dig in for the night.</p>

<p>Both Roise and Newton were confronted by serious space factors on
the night of 3–4 September. The 2d Battalion’s front was more than
2,000 yards long and formed a right angle. A gap of 500 yards stretched
between Company D’s precarious position on the northern tip of Hill
117 and Easy Company’s lines below Myong-ni. This left Smith’s
depleted unit isolated and Jaskilka’s right dangling.</p>

<p>The 1st Battalion’s right flank was exposed more than 1,000 yards
along the MSR; and its front was almost a mile in length, with a 200-yard<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
valley separating the two rifle companies. The Brigade Reconnaissance
Company was deployed on high ground far out on Newton’s left
flank, but this was hardly ample protection for the many avenues of
approach in the south.</p>

<p>Exhibiting his characteristic faith in high explosives, Newton called
on the 1st Platoon, Able Company Engineers, to contribute their sundry
lethal devices to 1/5’s infantry defense. Beginning at 1800, 3 September,
one group of engineers fanned out to the front and right flank of Company
B’s lines. Despite fire from Hill 117 and enemy positions to the
west, the demolitions men strung out dozens of antipersonnel mines,
hand grenades, and blocks of TNT wrapped with 60-penny spikes. Before
darkness set in, Baker Company’s forward slopes had the potential
of an active volcano.</p>

<p>In Company A’s zone, Technical Sergeant David N. Duncan and Sergeant
Bryan K. White led the other half of the engineer platoon in
laying a similar field of obstacles. Duncan crowned his handiwork with
a 40-pound shaped charge hooked up in a gully with a trip wire.</p>

<p>Staff Sergeant Saweren J. Dennis and his 2d Squad of engineers crept
forward at midnight 1,000 yards on the MSR and laid an antitank minefield
across the road near the southern tip of Hill 117. On the way
Dennis discovered an enemy antitank minefield embedded in the road.
Although the engineers had never seen a Russian wooden-box mine before,
knowledge gained from the study of intelligence manuals during
the Brigade’s sea voyage enabled them to detect, remove, and disarm
every mine in the field during darkness. The work was delayed a few
minutes when Dennis traced a clanking sound to the roadside ditch and
killed a Communist soldier frantically trying to insert a loaded magazine
into his submachinegun.</p>

<p>Before the engineers completed their work and retired to 1/5’s lines,
Nature added an obstacle of her own to any enemy plans for a counterattack.
A rainstorm broke, and the heavy downpour, accompanied by
unseasonably icy winds, wrought misery on friend and foe alike for the
rest of the night.</p>

<p class="drop-cap"><span class="smcap1">The casualties of</span> 2/5 for 3 September totaled 18 dead and 77
wounded, most of them being taken by Company D. Lieutenant
Colonel Murray ordered the 3d Battalion to pass through the 2d, therefore,
and continue the attack on the right of the MSR at 0800 the next
morning. The 1st Battalion was to resume its advance south of the MSR,
while the Reconnaissance Company far out on the left would move
forward to a new blocking position.<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">342</a></p>

Craig, 23 May 54; and Taplett, 20 Apr 54.</p></div>

<p>Shortly after dawn on the 4th, the 1st Platoon of engineers went
forward and removed the mines ahead of 1/5’s positions. Preparatory
fires by 1/11 at 0750 routed a group of enemy on the peak on Baker
Company’s front, and the Marine riflemen had a field day as the Reds
threw away their weapons and pelted westward.</p>

<p>Companies A and B jumped off at 0800 and advanced rapidly over the
high ground south of the MSR against negligible resistance. The attackers
frequently observed small groups of enemy fleeing in all directions,
and many of the Communists were cut down by Brigade air, artillery,
and armor. Twelve prisoners were captured before 1/5 reached its
half of Brigade Objective One at 1505. This was the high ground south
of the MSR at Kang-ni, over 3,000 yards from the line of departure.</p>

<p>Shortly after 0800, 3/5 had launched a two-pronged assault against
Hill 117, core of the NKPA 9th Division’s resistance the previous day.
Company G advanced through Easy Company’s lines just above the
MSR and pushed across the intervening rice paddies. The Marines<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
charged over a small knoll in their path but found the enemy positions
unoccupied except for several dead. Bohn quickly led the company to
the southern slopes of Hill 117, which was strangely quiet by comparison
with the tumult of the previous day. In capturing the southern half
of the hill, Company G killed only 15 North Koreans.</p>

<p>Simultaneously with Bohn’s advance, Company H swung wide to the
right and passed through the thin ranks of Dog Company on the northern
tip of Hill 117. The attackers drove south against negligible resistance
and quickly linked with Company G, securing the objective at 0840.</p>

<p>A connecting road runs from Myong-ni to the MSR, tracing the
eastern base of Hill 117. Since engineers on the previous night had located
the enemy minefield east of the junction on the main road, Taplett
moved his headquarters to the MSR via the connecting road. The lead
vehicle, a personnel carrier loaded with communications men, struck a
Communist mine on the secondary route east of the newly captured objective.
The resulting explosion caused 10 casualties.</p>

<p>By noon the engineers had cleared the road of several Russian-type
mines identical to those found during the night. The two anti-vehicular
minefields were among the first such obstacles encountered by the UN
forces in the Korean conflict.</p>

<p>After seizing Hill 117, Companies G and H continued the attack westward
by advancing abreast on the high ground north of the MSR. Contact
with 1/5 on the left was maintained, but the 9th Infantry on the
right soon fell behind and disappeared from sight.</p>

<p>At 1045 Company G ran into machinegun fire coming from the 3/5
area of the Brigade objective, the hill north of Kang-ni. Taplett blasted
the hill with Marine air and artillery, and the North Koreans were in
full retreat within an hour. MAG-33 and 1/11 rained death on the
retreating Reds and continued to pound the hill preparatory to an
assault by Company G. Bohn led his troops forward and secured the
objective at 1515.</p>

<p>Looking across the stream bed to the north of their new positions, the
Marines of George Company spotted enemy infantry escorting a T-34
tank and withdrawing into the 9th Infantry zone. The Communist
column was quickly dispersed by machinegun fire.</p>

<h3><i>Collapse of NKPA 9th Division</i></h3>

<p>Marines following up the 3,000-yard advance along the MSR saw, a
picture of devastation unequalled even by the earlier defeat of the NKPA<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
4th Division. Hundreds of enemy dead were strewn along the road, hillsides
and ridgelines. On the MSR between Hill 117 and Kang-ni lay a
long column of North Koreans who had been caught by Marine air and
artillery while attempting to reinforce Red lines. The dead leader was a
lieutenant colonel whose briefcase contained a lengthy artillery treatise
among other less scholarly documents.<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_343" href="#FNanchor_343" class="fnanchor">343</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>In addition to knocked-out and abandoned Communist tanks, vehicles,
mortars, and antitank guns, the countryside was littered with enough
small arms, ammunition, and gear to equip several hundred men. Even
the North Korean paymaster had been caught in the sweeping tide of
Brigade arms, and Marines distributed a huge quantity of worthless
currency among themselves.</p>

<p>Not only did the Marines reap a harvest of enemy materiel; they also
recaptured a great quantity of United States Army equipment lost during
the Communist drive. American tanks, artillery pieces, mortars,
vehicles, small arms, and ammunition and supply dumps were turned
over to the 2d Division by the Brigade.</p>

<p>The destruction of the enemy camp left Army and Marine intelligence
officers inundated by captured enemy documents. Muster rolls, ledgers,
maps, orders, textbooks, and propaganda material were heaped into
separate piles.</p>

<p>Late in the afternoon of 4 September, the 9th Infantry moved into
positions on the high ground northeast of 3/5. This completed the advance
to Phase Line One of the 2d Division’s counterattack plan. The
second phase line on G-3 maps was drawn through Hill 125 and
Observation Hill, 3,000 yards west of Kang-ni.</p>

<p>When informed that the Brigade had completed the first part of its
mission, General Keiser authorized General Craig to advance toward
Phase Line Two.</p>

<p>Beyond Kang-ni, the Brigade’s right boundary became the MSR, so
that 3/5 could not advance westward from its half of Objective One.
Major Charles H. Brush, Murray’s S-3, radioed Newton and passed on
orders for the battalion commander to take the next piece of high
ground, Cloverleaf Hill, just south of the MSR at Hwayong-ni, about a
thousand yards away.</p>

<p>The 1st Battalion struck out through the intervening rice paddy,
Company A on the left and Baker Company just below the MSR.
Fenton’s unit had hardly begun the advance when it was stopped by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
heavy machinegun fire coming from the high ground north of Hwayong-ni.
Newton then called for an air strike on the ridge and also
requested 3/5 to keep it covered with supporting fire during Company
B’s attack.</p>

<p>Enemy resistance evaporated with accustomed rapidity, and the Marines
reported Cloverleaf Hill secure at 1800. Murray then ordered both
front line battalions to establish night defenses and be prepared to continue
the attack at 0800, 5 September.</p>

<p>The extent and trace of the Brigade front line on the night of 4–5
September was almost identical to that of 24 hours before. Again Newton’s
battalion was in front on the left by a good 1,000 yards, and Companies
A and B were stretched across a line almost a mile long, with the
left flank wide open.</p>

<p>Separated from both 1/5 on the left and the 9th Infantry on the right,
the 3d Battalion established a perimeter defense, even though it was in
the center of the counterattack zone.</p>

<p>There was considerable tension and excitement after darkness on 4
September, although the Brigade lines were never seriously threatened.
The engineers were busy in 1/5’s zone until after midnight, creeping to
the front and flanks to lay mines. The 3d Battalion was shelled heavily
throughout the night, and 1/5’s CP took direct hits killing 1 Marine and
wounding 2 others. One of the wounded was Second Lieutenant James
R. Young, Newton’s Assistant S-3. The artillery liaison officer, First
Lieutenant Joris J. Snyder, was knocked unconscious for several hours,
though he received not a scratch from the 120-mm. explosion a few
yards away.</p>

<p>At 0230 night-fighter planes of Major Joseph H. Reinburg’s
VMF(N)-513 bombed the North Korean mortar position causing most
of the damage, and the shelling slackened appreciably. Completing this
mission, the Marine pilots dumped general purpose and fragmentation
bombs on enemy vehicles and troops in the area.<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">344</a></p>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_344" href="#FNanchor_344" class="fnanchor">344</a> VMF(N)-513 SAR, Appendix 6, 16.</p></div>

<p>Companies G and H reported movement forward of their lines before
dawn, and 3/5’s 81-mm. mortars quickly illuminated the front, disclosing
several small groups of enemy. There was a flurry of fire, but the
Reds gave no indication of organizing for an assault. One of the groups,
either by error or suicidal folly, stumbled into the area of Taplett’s CP.
A listening post of Weapons Company took the intruders under fire,
killing an NKPA officer and routing the others.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span></p>

<h3><i>Attacks of 5 September</i></h3>

<p>Marines of the 3d Battalion were startled at daybreak, 5 September,
when a company of North Koreans attacked the 9th Infantry’s left flank
in full view of 3/5’s positions on the adjacent high ground. George,
How, and H &amp; S Companies poured machinegun fire into the mass of
Reds at ranges of 600–1,000 yards. Most of the Red attackers were cut
down before they could flee into the hills west of the Army lines.<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">345</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_345" href="#FNanchor_345" class="fnanchor">345</a> This section is derived from: Annex How; 3/5 SAR, 1–6 Sep 50; Taplett, 20 Apr 54;
and Fenton, 8 May 54.</p></div>

<p>Company B, on its high ground south of Hwayong-ni, heard the firing
in 3/5’s area at daybreak and steeled itself for a possible counterattack
from the right flank. When Newton received word of the abortive
attack on the 9th Infantry, he ordered his two rifle companies to prepare
to move out at 0800 as planned.</p>

<p>The Marines of Companies A and B were organizing their attack formation
on Cloverleaf Hill when two Air Force P-51’s came in for an
uncontrolled air strike on the high ground north of Hwayong-ni. Strafing
the ridge from north to south, the planes riddled Cloverleaf Hill as
they pulled out of their dives. The 2 exposed companies were showered
with bullets, and it seemed miraculous that only 1 Marine was wounded.</p>

<p>At 0820, 1/5 jumped off to the west to seize the Brigade’s portion of
Phase Line Two—Hill 125 and Observation Hill. Beyond these hills lay
Obong-ni Ridge, blocking the path to the Naktong River, third and
final phase line of the 2d Division counterattack. Because of its tactical
importance and great significance, battle-scarred Obong-ni was designated
a special objective, apart from the phase lines.</p>

<p>Half a mile west of Hwayong-ni the MSR makes a right-angle turn
to the south, proceeds in that direction for 1,000 yards, then resumes its
westward course through the cut between Hill 125 and Observation
Hill.</p>

<p>Companies A and B, with the latter on the right, moved rapidly
through the rice paddy below the MSR after leaving their line of departure
on Cloverleaf Hill. At the road bend mentioned above, the MSR
turned across Baker Company’s front. When Fenton’s unit crossed over
to the base of the high ground leading to Hill 125, Companies A and B
were separated by the MSR as it resumed its westward course. Stevens’
unit started up the long eastern slopes of Observation Hill, while Fenton’s
men secured the eastern extension of Hill 125.</p>

<p>Obong-ni Ridge rumbled its first greeting to 1/5 at 0935 when<span class="pagenum"><a class="hidep" id="Page_232">232</a><a id="Page_233">233</a></span>
mortars and artillery fired at the Marine attackers from emplacements
around the hill. The Reds were answered immediately by 1/11 and
Newton’s 81-mm. mortar platoon; and the rifle companies continued
the advance to Phase Line Two, securing their objectives at 1100.</p>

  <div class="caption"><p>2nd NAKTONG COUNTEROFFENSIVE<br />
  <span class="smaller">ENEMY COUNTERATTACK—5 SEP. ’50</span></p></div></div>

<p>Murray ordered 1/5 to hold up until the 9th Infantry tied in on Fenton’s
right. Communist automatic weapons on Obong-ni Ridge fired on
the Marines sporadically during this interlude.</p>

<p>At 1000, while 1/5 was attacking to the west, the 3d Battalion had
swung southward behind Cloverleaf Hill to take positions on the 5th
Marines’ left. This was in preparation for Murray’s contemplated assault
on Obong-ni Ridge by two battalions. It was planned that Newton’s
unit would take the northern half of the long hill and 3/5 the southern
portion.</p>

<p>Company G led the 3d Battalion advance through the rice paddy
south of Cloverleaf Hill. Artillery and 75-mm. recoilless guns paved the
way by raking possible enemy hiding places, enabling the infantrymen
to proceed rapidly. Bohn’s destination was Hill 91, a shoe-like projection
jutting out from the southern reaches of Obong-ni Ridge. Reaching
the base of the high ground, Bohn requested that supporting fires
be lifted. Attached tanks, 75’s, and 1/11 immediately shifted their destruction
to Obong-ni Ridge.</p>

<p>Company G started up the slopes of Hill 91, while an attached 75-mm.
recoilless gun obliterated a wheel-mounted machinegun and its
crew going into position on the crest. The Marines had climbed only a
few yards when Bohn was ordered by Taplett at 1230 to withdraw the
company to Observation Hill.</p>

<p>Company H, then passing between Hill 91 and Observation Hill on
its way to Obong-ni’s eastern approaches, received the same order from
the Battalion commander. The assault on the ridge had been canceled,
and Murray was concentrating his regiment along the MSR.</p>

<h3><i>Two Marine Tanks Killed</i></h3>

<p>Throughout the Brigade advance on 5 September, the Marines were
hampered by heavy rain and fog which prevented MAG-33 and VMO-6
from operating effectively. Thus the enemy was offered a rare opportunity
to mount a daylight attack.<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">346</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_346" href="#FNanchor_346" class="fnanchor">346</a> This section is derived from: Annex How; LtCol M. R. Olson, interv with author, 15
Jun 54; Taplett, 20 Apr 54; Muetzel, 5–6 Jan 54 (with comments by Maj J. R. Stevens);
and Fenton, 8 May 54.</p></div>

<p>After Company B received orders to hold up on Hill 125, Fenton ordered
his men to dig foxholes along the rain-soaked crest facing Tugok
village and Finger Ridge to the west and Obong-ni Ridge to the southwest.
The company commander directed the attached 1st Platoon of
tanks to remain in the road cut, just to the rear of the famous bend
around the forward slopes of Hill 125. Peering through the rain and fog,
the Marine tankmen could see the dead, black hulls of the three T-34’s
knocked out by the Brigade 2 weeks earlier.</p>

<p>At 1420 the sporadic sniping from the front suddenly increased to the
intensity of preparatory fire, and Baker Company was pinned down on
its ridgeline positions. The northern tip of Obong-ni Ridge blazed with
NKPA machineguns, whose chatter was soon joined by that of automatic
weapons concealed in Tugok and at the northern base of Observation
Hill. A Communist antitank gun on Finger Ridge added its voice
intermittently to the chorus.</p>

<p>Fenton’s radio went dead just as he reported the situation to Newton
at his OP on the high ground to the east. As luck would have it, every
other radio in the company area was inoperative because of the mud and
rain; and Fenton was unable to warn the Marine tanks in the road cut
that enemy armor and troops were advancing toward the road bend
from the west.</p>

<p>As the Communist vehicles swung into the turn, a company of Red
soldiers left the road and assaulted Company B’s positions by advancing
up the draw on the Marines’ left front. The intense overhead fire supporting
the Red Infantry enabled them to get well up the forward
slopes. Meanwhile, a squad of North Koreans advanced up the draw
leading from Tugok and harassed Fenton’s right front.</p>

<p>To stop the attack, the Marines were forced to man the crest of Hill
125. Thus exposed to the enemy’s supporting fire, Company B had to
pay a heavy price in casualties.</p>

<p>During the advance of the Communist armor, it was determined that
the first 2 of the 3 vehicles were T-34 tanks and the last a tracked
armored personnel carrier. Fenton immediately deployed his assault
squad on the slopes below his left flank to meet the threat on the MSR.</p>

<p>Lieutenant Pomeroy, unaware of the enemy tanks around the bend,
advanced his M-26’s so that the machineguns on Obong-ni Ridge could
be taken under massed fire. Thus, as the first Marine tank reached the
bend, its 90-mm. gun was pointing to the left front, a quarter turn away
from the enemy armor.</p>

<p>The lead T-34 fired on the Marine vehicle as soon as it came into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
view. Before the turret of the M-26 could be turned to take aim, several
more 85-mm. projectiles struck; and the Brigade lost its first tank to
enemy action. The second M-26 in column tried to squeeze by the first
to render assistance, and it too was knocked out by 85-mm. fire in the
restricted passageway.</p>

<p>The crews of both Marine tanks managed to get out of their vehicles
through the escape hatches. Some of the wounded were aided by the
engineer mine-clearance team accompanying the tank column.</p>

<p>Since the road bend was now blocked, the remainder of Pomeroy’s
tanks could do nothing but park in the road cut. It was Marine infantrymen
who stepped in at this point and blunted the NKPA victory on the
MSR.</p>

<p>Company B’s assault squad plastered the lead T-34 with 3.5″ rocket
fire and stopped it cold. Shortly afterwards, the 1st Battalion’s assault
platoon reached the fight scene and went into action with its 3.5’s. In
short order the infantrymen had completed the destruction of the first
tank, knocked out the second, and destroyed the enemy personnel carrier.</p>

<p>The historic road bend, as seen through the rain and mist, had become
a graveyard of armor. A total of 8 steel monsters were sprawled there in
death: 5 T-34’s and 1 armored carrier of the NKPA, and 2 Pershing
tanks of the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade.</p>

<h3><i>The Brigade’s Final Action</i></h3>

<p>On Hill 125 the fight reached a climax as Marines exchanged grenades
and small-arms fire with the North Koreans slithering up the slopes in
the driving rain. Company B had used all of its 60-mm. mortar shells
and was running low on grenades and small arms ammunition. Enemy
automatic weapons on the ridges to the front were still cutting down
the Marine defenders at 1500 when Fenton sent a runner to Newton requesting
more ammunition.<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">347</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_347" href="#FNanchor_347" class="fnanchor">347</a> <i>Ibid.</i></p></div>

<p>The endurance contest was still in progress half an hour later, as the
9th Infantry moved into positions on the high ground north of Hill 125.
Having no communications with his own supporting arms, Fenton sent
a messenger to the Army unit commander, asking that he place artillery
fire on the Marine front.</p>

<p>When Army shells began falling in answer to the request, 1/5’s 81-mm.
mortars belatedly got into the fight and worked over the forward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
slopes of Hill 125 to within 50 yards of Company B’s positions. The
heavy supporting fire turned the tide, and enemy pressure slackened
considerably.</p>

<p>During the final stage of the enemy’s attack, Company A was being
relieved on Observation Hill by 3/5. Stevens told his platoon leaders to
leave their grenades and extra ammunition on the hill, since his orders
were to withdraw to the rear. While the relief was taking place, however,
Company A was ordered to reinforce Fenton’s unit against the enemy’s
attack on Hill 125. Muetzel’s 2d Platoon, after recovering its ammunition,
was augmented by a machinegun section, mortar squad, and
two SCR-300 radios, before the young officer led the unit across the
MSR to lend a hand.</p>

<p>When Stevens’ relief by 3/5 was completed, he added the 1st Platoon
to Company B’s reinforcements, and himself withdrew to Cloverleaf
Hill with the 3d Platoon as ordered.</p>

<p>The reinforcements were fed into Fenton’s line as fast as they reached
the summit of Hill 125. By this time every man in Company B had been
committed to the forward wall—mortarmen, clerks, signalmen, and all.
Lieutenant Howard Blank combined his Able Company mortars with
those of the defenders and immediately followed up the artillery and
81-mm. fire which had blunted the attack. These final concentrations of
60-mm. mortar fire on Obong-ni and Finger Ridges and the forward
slopes of Hill 125 ended the enemy attack. The surviving Reds withdrew
to Tugok.</p>

<p>At 1600, during the dying minutes of the Brigade’s final action in the
Pusan Perimeter, Newton was ordered back to the regimental CP for a
conference. The executive officer, Major Merlin R. Olson, took over 1/5
from the battalion OP on the ridge east of Hill 125.</p>

<p>The 5th Marines commander had called the leaders of his battalions
to brief them on General Craig’s last field directive, which began with
the long awaited words:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“THIS MY OPN ORDER 22-50 X COMMENCING AT 2400 5 SEPT BRIG MOVES
BY RAIL AND MOTOR TO STAGING AREA PUSAN FOR FURTHER OPERATION
AGAINST THE ENEMY X PRIOR TO COMMENCEMENT OF MOVEMENT
5TH MARS WILL STAND RELIEVED BY ELMS OF 2ND INF DIV COMMENCING
AT DARKNESS ... CONCEAL FROM THE ENEMY ACTIVITIES CONNECTED
WITH YOUR WITHDRAWAL....”</p></blockquote>

<p>Taplett’s 3d Battalion had sustained 24 casualties from artillery and
mortar fire between its occupation of Observation Hill and the time it
was relieved by a company of the 23d Infantry shortly after midnight.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
Plodding rearward through mud and driving rain, 3/5’s long column began
its three-and-a-half-mile march to an entrucking point 2,000 yards
west of Yongsan.</p>

<p>Following 3/5 were the weary, mud-soaked troops of the 1st Battalion.
Having successfully defended Hill 125 at a cost of 2 killed and 23
wounded, Baker Company had filed down to the road after being relieved
by another company of the 23d Infantry. Muetzel brought up the
rear with Company A’s contingent, and a battalion column was formed
at Olson’s check point east of Hill 125.</p>

<p>By dawn of 6 September, the two battalions were loading aboard
trucks to follow the rest of the Brigade. Numbed by fatigue and icy rain,
the bent forms huddled together in the cargo vehicles had no regrets as
they bade good-bye to the Pusan perimeter.</p>

<h3><i>Brigade Embarkation at Pusan</i></h3>

<p>The movement to Pusan was completed by the morning of 7 September,
and the Brigade troops found themselves back at the docks where they
had landed a little more than a month before. In fact, the docks were to
be their bivouac area during the next 6 days; the men slept in the open
and took their meals on board the transports in which they would soon
be sailing around the peninsula.</p>

<p>The survivors of the Naktong fights—even the latecomers who had
joined the Brigade at the Bean Patch—felt old and worn when they saw
the large draft of shiny new Marines just landed as third rifle companies
organized with their own NCO’s and platoons. The veterans had forgotten
how young and untroubled a Marine could look; how neat and
clean he could appear in a recently issued utility jacket.</p>

<p>The new companies were immediately assigned to their battalions. It
was another job for officers and NCO’s who had the responsibility of replacing
equipment lost in action as well as servicing ordnance, motor
transport and other heavy equipment which had been sent from the
Bean Patch to Pusan late in August.<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">348</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_348" href="#FNanchor_348" class="fnanchor">348</a> Col J. L. Stewart, interv with author, 10 Jun 54.</p></div>

<p>General Craig and his staff had their headquarters in one of the Pusan
University buildings. There was no opportunity for planning, let alone
rehearsals, for the forthcoming amphibious assault at Inchon. Craig and
his officers had all they could do to get the Brigade ready for embarkation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
Among the tasks to be accomplished in less than a week, it remained
to give some weapons training to the 3,000 troops of the 1st Korean
Marine Regiment. This newly raised unit, attached to the Brigade for
embarkation, was to make a name for itself within the next year and become
the fourth rifle regiment of the 1st Marine Division. But in September
1950 there were great gaps in the training of the KMC’s. The
men kept their rifles scrupulously clean, and they could strip an M-1
expertly, but few of them had ever fired a shot.</p>

<p>Marine NCO’s had the hazardous duty of giving the eager and excited
KMC’s their first target practice after eight rounds of ammunition for
each man had been acquired. No Marine casualties resulted, fortunately,
but puffed and bruised cheeks were the rule among Koreans having
their first experience with an M-1’s recoil.</p>

<p>There was, of course, no end of “scuttlebutt” going the rounds of the
Marines as to their destination. One day the troops were lined up in formation
and read a long lecture on the hydrographic aspects of the west
coast port of Kunsan. It is to be hoped that this red herring made some
impression upon the Koreans who were listening, since Pusan was a
headquarters of enemy spies. As for the Marines, most of them concluded
that at least Kunsan could be eliminated from the list of possible
objectives.</p>

<p>The secret was well kept by Brigade officers in the higher echelons.
Two engineer officers, First Lieutenant Ernest P. Skelt and Commissioned
Warrant Officer Willard C. Downs, were given the secret mission
of constructing wooden scaling ladders for the next operation. This
project gave rise to more rumors, but it is safe to say that few men in
the ranks knew the answer when the Brigade was deactivated at 0001 on
13 September 1950. The components immediately resumed their old
unit designations in the 1st Marine Division and sailed to take part in
the amphibious assault on Inchon scheduled for the 15th.<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">349</a></p>

devoted to Marine operations in Korea.</p></div>

<h3><i>Results of Brigade Operations</i></h3>

<p>As the mountains behind Pusan faded from sight, General Craig and
his men could reflect that the Brigade’s 67 days of existence had been
productive. Altogether, the Marine air-ground team had fought three
difficult offensive operations in a month while traveling 380 miles with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
a third of its organic transportation plus Army vehicles.</p>

<p>Total casualties for the Brigade included 148 KIA, 15 DOW, 9 MIA
(seven of whom were later reclassified as KIA after recovery of the
bodies) and 730 WIA.<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">350</a> It was estimated that the Marines inflicted total
casualties of 9,900 killed and wounded on opposing NKPA units. Enemy
losses of arms and equipment were on such a scale as to impair the
effectiveness of the forces concerned.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_350" href="#FNanchor_350" class="fnanchor">350</a> Brig SAR, basic report.</p></div>

<p>In its initial operation, as a component of Task Force Kean, the Brigade
had the major part in the first sustained Eighth Army counterattack—the
military equivalent of a hard left jab which rocks an opponent
back on his heels. General MacArthur, when reporting to the United
Nations, asserted that “this attack not only secured the southern approaches
to the beachhead, but also showed that the North Korean
forces will not hold under attack.”<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">351</a></p>

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_351" href="#FNanchor_351" class="fnanchor">351</a> MCBS, I-II-A-18-19. This valuable operational study by Marine senior officers has
been the guide for the summaries and analyses of Brigade results in these pages.</p></div>

<p>The Communist drive in this sensitive area came closest of all NKPA
thrusts to the vital UN supply port of Pusan. Up to that time the
NKPA units spearheading the advance—the 6th Infantry Division and
the 83d Motorcycle Regiment—had never suffered a reverse worth mentioning
since the outset of the invasion. Then the counterattack by the
1st Provisional Marine Brigade hurled the enemy back 26 miles in 4
days from the Chindong-ni area to Sachon.</p>

<p>It was estimated that the Marine air-ground team killed and wounded
1,900 of the enemy while destroying nearly all the vehicles of an NKPA
motorized battalion in addition to infantry armament and equipment.
The enemy threat in this critical area was nullified for the time being,
and never again became so serious. Marine efforts assisted Army units
of Task Force Kean in taking new defensive positions and defending
them with fewer troops, thus freeing some elements for employment on
other fronts. Finally, the Marines earned more time and space for the
building up of Eighth Army forces in preparation for a decisive UN
counteroffensive.</p>

<p>The next Brigade operation, the first battle of the Naktong, ranks
with the hardest fights of Marine Corps history. The enemy, after showing
skill and aggressiveness in breaching the last natural barrier of the
Pusan Perimeter, widened his Naktong bridgehead and took strong defensive
positions in preparation for an all-out offensive while still maintaining
his material superiority.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
Only two Eighth Army units were available for a counterattack—the
27th Infantry and the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade. The Army regiment
being needed in reserve on the southern front, the “firemen of the
Pusan Perimeter” were placed under the operational control of the 24th
Infantry Division on the central front. There the Marines had the
mission of clearing the enemy from Obong-ni Ridge and two other large
hill masses of the Naktong Bulge.</p>

<p>The NKPA 4th Infantry Division had taken maximum advantage of
strong defensive terrain in accordance with the precepts taught by Soviet
and Chinese Communist military instructors. This enlarged bridgehead
was credited by CINCFE with giving the enemy the capability of
mounting a serious threat to the main railroad from Pusan to Taegu.</p>

<p>It took a bitter and costly effort on the part of the Brigade, but the
result was the most smashing defeat ever given an NKPA major unit up
to this time. This reverse turned into a rout and slaughter toward the
end as Marine air, artillery, armor, and mortars inflicted terrible losses.
Broken NKPA forces were cut down in flight or while trying to swim
the Naktong.</p>

<p>If the Brigade’s first operation may be likened to a hard left jab, the
fight in the Naktong Bulge is comparable to a solid right dealing a
knockdown blow. The enemy lurched back to his feet, it is true, but the
three rifle regiments of the NKPA 4th Infantry Division had to be filled
up with hastily trained recruits.</p>

<p>Arms ranging from rifles to howitzers were abandoned as impediments
by the routed Communists, so that the rebuilt NKPA 4th Infantry
Division needed new armament and equipment of all sorts. General
MacArthur’s summary of the action, reported to the UN Security
Council on 18 September 1950, stated that “attacks by the United States
24th Division and the Marines eliminated a major penetration of the
Naktong defense line on 18 August. Here, the enemy 4th Division was
decisively defeated, lost its bridgehead, and was thrown westward across
the Naktong River, suffering very heavy losses in both personnel and
equipment.”</p>

<p>Never before had a major NKPA unit taken such a staggering defeat.
As evidence of recent victories won over United States troops, the 4th
Infantry Division had brought captured American machineguns and
105-mm. howitzers into the Naktong Bulge. Among the most important
results achieved by the Brigade, therefore, was the hurt done to Red
Korean morale.</p>

<p>Not only was the enemy’s Naktong bridgehead liquidated; he also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
lost heavily in time, which was becoming more valuable to him than
space if he hoped to profit from his rapidly dwindling advantage in numbers.
Not until 10 days later did the Communists establish another
bridgehead in the Naktong Bulge area, and then it was their misfortune
to encounter the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade again.</p>

<p>During the early morning hours of 1 September 1950, the enemy
made his final effort to smash through to Pusan. Again the 27th Infantry
was needed on another front, so that the Marines, as the only other
mobile reserve unit, were committed under the operational control of
the 2d Infantry Division, The seriousness of the situation in the Naktong
Bulge is indicated by the fact that the enemy had enlarged his new
bridgehead with a penetration of about 4,000 yards in the sector of the
2d Division. Elements of four enemy divisions had been identified on
the central front when the Marines jumped off on the morning of 3
September.</p>

<p>The Brigade’s 3-day fight did not end as decisively as the first battle
of the Naktong. That is because it was an unfinished fight. The Marines
were pulled out on the night of 5 September, after gains of 2,500 to
3,000 yards that day, and it can only be conjectured what General Craig
and his men might have accomplished during the next 48 hours.</p>

<p>As it was, the Brigade had a prominent part in disrupting the enemy’s
effort to sever the Pusan-Taegu lifeline. Heavy losses both in personnel
and equipment were inflicted on NKPA forces, and the Marines helped
to reduce the enemy’s new bridgehead by 8,000 to 10,000 yards.</p>

<p>Not only had the enemy lost the battle; he had lost the war, as it
proved, for EUSAK staff officers were even then planning a great UN
counterstroke in the Pusan Perimeter. This drive was to be in conjunction
with the amphibious assault on Inchon.</p>

<p>The turning point in the UN fortunes of war owed in no small measure
to the three counterattacks by the Marines in the Pusan Perimeter.
As for the overall effects, it would be hard to improve upon the analysis
and evaluation in the Marine Corps Board Study:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“A careful examination of any of these operations in which Marines engaged discloses
that a single failure would have a profound effect upon the entire UN effort....
On 3 separate occasions the Brigade was attached to the defending UN forces
at points of dangerous enemy penetrations and 3 times Marine units spearheaded
the counterattacking elements and effectively stopped the enemy’s efforts, seizing
the initiative from him, inflicting serious losses upon him, and forcing the abandonment
of immediate attempts at decisive penetration.”<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">352</a></p></blockquote>

<h3><i>Summaries and Conclusions</i></h3>

<p>No Marine tactical organization of history ever did more than the Brigade
to uphold the tradition of the Corps as a force-in-readiness. The
transition from activation to embarkation took only 6 days, and it may
be recalled that the Brigade became the first United States unit to get
into the fight after crossing the Pacific from the American mainland.</p>

<p>Although the components had been hastily thrown together without
opportunity for training or rehearsals, there were singularly few instances
of tactical fumbling during the early actions. Some of the men
had their only weapons familiarization instruction in actual battle, when
they fired new arms for the first time. But thanks to the steadying influence
of combat-wise company officers and NCO’s, the Marines of the
Brigade soon gained competence.</p>

<p>The Brigade command and staff faced unusual problems arising from
such factors as emergency situations, hurried planning, oral orders, incomplete
intelligence, and lack of adequate maps. There were decisions
now and then which officers would not have made if they had been endowed
with the wisdom of knowledge after the event. But on the basis
of information at the time, the Brigade command and staff need no
whitewashing from history. Marine victories, on the other hand, may be
attributed in large degree to a high order of leadership and professional
ability in the upper echelons as well as on the company and platoon
level.</p>

<p>It might have been argued that it was a waste to commit amphibious
specialists to the operations of mountain warfare. But Marines were also
trained as infantry, and gravel-crunching fighting men were needed to
correct an illusion held by many of their countrymen. Atomic bombs,
guided missiles, jet planes, and other marvelous new weapons had convinced
a large section of the public that the day of push-button warfare
was at hand. These Americans sincerely believed that wars could be
waged at long distance, and the Marines of the Brigade served their
country well by demonstrating that even in the tactical millenium it was
necessary to seek out the enemy and close with him. For if there was any
outstanding figure of the conflict in Korea, it was some second lieutenant
making split-second decisions which meant life or death for a
platoon holding a hill position against enemy attack in the darkness.</p>

<p>The three squadrons of MAG-33 provided support which the Brigade
reported as “the best close air support in the history of the Marine
Corps ... outstanding in its effectiveness.” Army infantry officers were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
frankly envious on occasion; and Colonel Paul L. Freeman, USA, commanding
the 23d Infantry, commented that “the Marines on our left
were a sight to behold. Not only was their equipment superior or equal
to ours, but they had squadrons of air in direct support. They used it like
artillery. It was ‘Hey, Joe—This is Smitty—Knock the left of that ridge
in front of Item Company.’ They had it <em>day and night</em>. It came off nearby
carriers, and not from Japan with only 15 minutes of fuel to accomplish
mission.”<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">353</a></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p class="fn3"><a id="Footnote_353" href="#FNanchor_353" class="fnanchor">353</a> Quoted in MCBS, I-II-A-35; and I-IV-B-9.</p></div>

<p>The UN forces, of course, had complete supremacy in the air. On two
occasions the Marines of the Brigade were briefly strafed by NKPA night
hecklers making a “scalded-cat” raid. During the interlude at the Bean
Patch an enemy plane winged its way under cover of darkness to cut
loose with a brief burst of machinegun bullets before disappearing into
the night. But United States Air Force planes had virtually destroyed the
little NKPA air force during the first few weeks of the war, so that the
men of the Brigade were virtually unopposed in the air.</p>

<p>The time interval between a request for Marine air support and the
actual delivery varied according to local conditions, but the ground
forces seldom had cause for complaint. All-weather Squadron VMF(N)-513,
based at Itazuke, Japan, was prevented by reason of faulty communications
and liaison from responding to every request for dawn, dusk
or night support during early Brigade operations, but such missions were
flown effectively in the Naktong Bulge. Meanwhile, the Corsairs of
VMF-214 and VMF-323, orbiting on station and always available for
short notice employment, gave fresh proof that the Navy-Marine concept
of carrier-based tactical aircraft was sound in practice. Following are
the statistics of MAG-33 operations in Korea from 3 August to 14
September 1950:</p>

<p>Demands on the time of the original 4 helicopters of VMO-6 made it
necessary to fly 2 more machines in from Japan. The rotary-wing aircraft<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
had so many “firsts” to their credit in the Pusan Perimeter that a major
tactical innovation was obviously in the making. The flights of General
Craig, Colonel Snedeker and Lieutenant Colonel Stewart alone were
enough to indicate that the helicopter was capable of working a
revolution in command and staff procedures.</p>

<p>Altogether, the participation of the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade
was an important factor in stopping the NKPA invasion in August 1950
and punishing the invaders so severely that they were ripe for a crushing
defeat the following month. The Marines, moreover, did a great deal to
restore the national pride of countrymen who had been hurt and
bewildered by the outcome of the first month’s operations.</p>

<p>It was humiliating to read on the front page that only 5 years after
reaching our greatest military strength of history, United States troops
were being pushed around by Asiatic peasants of a Soviet-trained organization
calling itself the North Korean People’s Army. Perhaps these
Americans did not remember that the decline in our Armed Forces was
due to overwhelming popular demands for the disbanding of our victorious
armies of 1945. At any rate, the United States paid the penalty of
unpreparedness in 1950 when its first ground-force units were beaten by
better trained and equipped NKPA troops. Worse yet, correspondents at
the front intimated that these defeats were due to the softness of our
youth. It was charged that United States troops had been so pampered by
motor transport that they could no longer march, let alone fight.</p>

<p>The Marines helped to change all that. The Marines and the better
Army units proved that they were more than a match for the enemy
when it came to marching as well as fighting. The Marines did their best
to restore the pride of Americans who read about the advance to Kosong
or the fight on Obong-ni Ridge. The Marines, in short, deserved the pat
on the back conveyed in a dispatch to the Brigade on 23 August 1950
from their Commandant, General Clifton B. Cates:</p>

</p>

<p>The First United States Provisional Marine Brigade was a vital element in the first
major counterattack against the enemy.</p>

<p>In late July and early August 1950, the enemy had swept through the Chulla
Provinces and had rapidly approached along the south Korean coast to a point only
35 miles from the vital port of Pusan. Together with the 25th Infantry Division, the
First United States Provisional Marine Brigade, from 7 August to 12 August 1950,
played a major role in attacking and driving back the enemy.</p>

<p>During the period 17 August to 20 August 1950 in conjunction with the 24th
Infantry Division and units of the 2d Infantry Division, the First United States Provisional
Marine Brigade attacked a great pocket of enemy forces who had successfully
crossed the Naktong River and established a firm beachhead on the eastern
bank. The Brigade attacked with such determination and skill as to earn the admiration
of all who saw or knew of its battle conduct.</p>

<p>Later, on the night of 31 August-1 September, the enemy again launched an all-out
offensive against the United Nations Forces. The First United States Provisional
Marine Brigade was in Army reserve at that time. With the 2d Infantry Division,
the Brigade again was committed in almost the same area of its earlier action
against the Naktong pocket in the neighborhood of Yongsan. Again the gallant
Marine forces were instrumental in preventing the enemy from capturing their objective
and cutting the north-south lines of communication of the United Nations
Forces.</p>

<p>The brilliant performance of duty in combat in Korea of each individual of the
First United States Provisional Marine Brigade is in accord with the highest traditions
of the military service.</p>

<p>This citation carries with it the right to wear the Presidential Unit Citation Ribbon
by each individual of the First United States Provisional Marine Brigade which
served in Korea in the stated period.</p>

<p class="in0">for service as set forth in the following <span class="smcap">Citation</span>:</p>

<p>“For extraordinary heroism in action against enemy aggressor forces in Korea
from 7 August to 7 September 1950. Functioning as a mobile, self-contained, air-ground
team, the First Provisional Marine Brigade, Reinforced, rendered invaluable
service during the fierce struggle to maintain the foothold established by friendly
forces in the Pusan area during the early stages of the Korean conflict. Quickly
moving into action as numerically superior enemy forces neared the Naktong River
on the central front and penetrated to within 35 miles of Pusan in the southern
sector, threatening the integrity of the entire defensive perimeter, this hard-hitting,
indomitable team counterattacked serious enemy penetrations at three different
points in rapid succession. Undeterred by roadblocks, heavy hostile automatic
weapons and highly effective artillery fire, extremely difficult terrain and intense
heat, the Brigade met the invaders with relentless determination and, on each crucial
occasion, hurled them back in disorderly retreat. By combining sheer resolution
and esprit de corps with sound infantry tactics and splendid close air support, the
Brigade was largely instrumental in restoring the line of defense, in inflicting thousands
of casualties upon the enemy and in seizing large amounts of ammunition,
equipment and other supplies. The brilliant record achieved by the unit during the
critical early days of the Korean conflict attests to the individual valor and competence
of the officers and men and reflects the highest credit upon the First Provisional
Marine Brigade, Reinforced, and the United States Naval Service.”</p>

<p>All of the First Provisional Marine Brigade except the First Amphibian Tractor
Company participated in operations against enemy aggressor forces in Korea from
7 August to 7 September 1950.</p>

<p>The following reinforcing units of the First Provisional Marine Brigade participated
in operations against enemy aggressor forces in Korea from 7 August to 7
September 1950:</p>

<p class="hang">Forward Echelon, First Marine Aircraft Wing (less ground personnel)</p>

<p>1. It gives me great pleasure to commend you, your officers and men, for the part
your organization played in the successful attack which began 17 August 50 against
a determined enemy occupying a bridgehead east of the <span class="smcap">Naktong River</span> in the
vicinity of <span class="smcap">Kujin-San</span> and ended only when the bridgehead had been eliminated
with great loss of men and equipment to the enemy.</p>

<p>2. Through excellence in leadership and grit and determination in all ranks, your
organization helped materially in preventing the enemy from penetrating our lines
at a critical time. In so doing it has upheld the fine tradition of the Marines in a
glorious manner and by close cooperation has proved unification of the services a
success.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you

    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &bull; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
